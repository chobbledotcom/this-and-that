Great food, good prices.

---

Fsntasztikus választék, különleges halak.

---

Amazing place, great value, very tasty, no frills, just lovely food.

---

Really good food for very cheap. Kind service too

---

Terrific hole in the wall joint, no frills just excellent comfort food. Dishes rotate daily, so you'll never be bored with multiple visits.

---

Great little place that serves rice and curry.  Plenty of different choice of curries on offer as well as kebabs and samosas however their speciality is rice and curry.  Mix and match meat and vegetable curries to create a fusion of different flavours.  Their reputation and popularity has spread by word of mouth which is the best form of advertising.

---

The best ,simple , affordable delicious sexy food that you will not taste anywhere else in the North West.

---

You won't find a better meal for a fiver.

---

Great price great food

---

Located in a small alleyway, this restaurant is the ultimate fast food.
As a first timer it was a bit confusing to order, basically choose 3 types of curries/dishes and each day there’s a specific selection. Price would differentiate based on how many “meat” dishes you ordered.
Delicious and cheap but with authentic flavors. Lunch hours gets pretty crowded and chaotic so recommendation to come early or later for a more relaxing dining experience

---

Best small restaurant in manchester staff friendly food excellent prices very reasonable
My grandson loves it

---

Amazing food, nothing more to say, it's a must, get yourself down there for the most tasty food at cheap prices, you will not be disappointed x

---

Best currys ever

---

便宜好吃 真的很好吃的印度咖哩
最多能選三項咖哩

---

Best indian food

---

V V tasty

---

Great place for a quick meal. Food is really nice, homemade and tasty. You get your plate immediately as you order. Staff is friendly.

---

I was at the door as they opened so I was the first customer.
I went for the fish curry, lamb and spinach and keema with rice, a roti and a glass of mango lassi.
As always the food was fantastic,  think the total price was £10.20, which is a bargain.
This and Thats remains in my top 3 curry houses.

---

Authentic, cheap, great indian food.

---

Always a lovely experience

---

If you have been, you know ! Finest food in town.

---

Truly is World famous! Been coming here for years on the odd occasion and this time I took my son, Dylan with me. He liked the food and wondered why it was like the school canteen...that's its appeal! Was sat next to an American woman who was married to a Yorkshireman and they lived in Japan! Food was ace as per usual...thank This and That X

---

Gute Portion, preiswert und lecker :) sehr gut

---

Mad munch

---

Down to earth comfort food! Can't ask for much more

---

Such good food v cheap, must go

---

Amazing lunch of dal, lamb n spinach and chicken tikka :D

---

Yum full as f@rk

---

Loved it , great food at really descent prices . Will definitely pay another visit

---

Absolutely 💯 amazing food also service really lovely vibe!!

---

Best food ever been going for 30 years.

---

Superb Indian Cafe! Quite basic inside and out but food and prices cannot be beaten!

---

Great value, tasty food with plenty of variety at a hole in the wall establishment and friendly service from the owner!

---

Good quality food at very reasonable rates. Had 3 curries - chicken tikka masala, mutton kheema and potato cauliflower curry with rice and finished with mango lassi. There was a lot of flavour in curries! Could taste different kinds of spices but not spicy at all. Mutton kheema was really good and Mango lassi was perfect for a sweet and cool drink after a satisfying meal !! One plate of 3 curry and rice with Lassi was filling for 2 people!

---

Great food and the people who run it are amazing. Highly recommend it

---

The food was absolutely amazing and the owners were extremely friendly and kind! Will surely come back to this place!

The three curries dish is a must.

---

Try rice with 3 option

---

Amazing authentic food, great little gem in Manchester!

---

Nice traditional food. Like home cooking!

---

Caché dans une ruelle, on ne s'attend pas à être si bien accueilli. Le serveur est très sympa et discute facilement. Les plats sont bons, pas aussi bien présentés que dans un restaurant "classique", disons que c'est indian fast food. Parfait quand on a peu de temps et pas besoin de l'ambiance restaurant.

---

Great for 'rice and three' Indian meal.

---

Tasty cheap restaurant,  location or decor should be overlooked if you want to go there

---

Literal una gidden gem, ya que está en un callejón. Una buena opción para comer estilo hindú, rico y económico. Dos personas unos 20€ en Manchester es una maravilla. Llevan muchos años y se ve que está muy orientado a un público trabajador y de la zona y por ello mantienen precios populares. Sin lujos ni para ir buscando un ambiente para algo especial pero sí para alimentarte bien y a buen precio.

---

Meilleure resto indien de Manchester 😍

---

Simple home cooking packed with sophisticated flavours. I've had chana on many occasions before but the way this place layers the spice mix is next level. The owner (?) Is very friendly and makes great conversation. He saw that we were new to the city and offered us two delicious cups of mango lassi. Definitely worth a visit!

---

Friendly staff and lovely food

---

Nice place for food

---

Just tried liver and kidney, amazing

---

THE BEST!!!!
So lucky to have bumped into this little Gem!
Amazing food, friendly staff, incredible value for money!
I wish there will be a place like this in Glasgow!
cannot wait to go back and try all the delicious dishes!!!!

THANKS A LOT THIS AND THAT! you are the best!

---

A hidden treasure - Quite literally! The place is hidden in a rundown alley of Manchester and with construction work around it’s tougher to locate this place but once you find the treasure, you are in for a treat. It’s a must try place of people who want to enjoy Pakistani cuisine on a budget.

Value: Super cheap! My rice and 3 curries along with Diet Coke costed me 9 quid. That’s it. The portion size is big so you aren’t paying a bomb for bite size plates.

Location: Heart of the city yet quite secluded. A 3 minutes walk from Arndale, as mentioned earlier, this place is hidden. The walk to this place may look all dingy but this is most of the hidden places in Manchester alleys!

Food: They have a set menu where you have option to pick 3 out of almost 6-8 curries. You have chicken, lamb and vegetarian/ vegan options as well. On top of that you can pay more for starters (mostly samosa and bhajiyas) and soft drink.

Service : The staff is friendly and welcoming. A canteen/mess feel to the place.

Advice to management: A little more on hygiene will be great like adding gloves and hair caps but overall great.

A must visit especially a steal during these times of high inflated market with rising cost of living.

---

I’ve really learnt to never judge a place by it looks. The food was very authentic and the cost was insanely cheap. With an average of £7 per dish, it was very filling. I loved the fast service and excellent food quality.

---

Highly recommended

---

This is indeed a hidden gem in Manchester!!!

I got a 2 meat + 1 veg + rice set for 7 pounds. The portion was huge, definitely enough for ppl who are starving. There was a generous amount of meat in the curry, and the lamb was especially impressive with its extreme tenderness. HIGHLY recommend ppl who eat lamb to try their lamb dishes!!! Both chicken and lamb curry were spicy but great for those who need some heat on these chilly days. The mixed vegetable curry was kinda sweet, great to have it with spicy flavours.

A MUST in this restaurant is definitely the mango lassi. Ppl who love lassi PLEASE order it, you will not regret it (or else you will be regretful 🤣) this is the BEST lassi I’ve had in my entire life. Thick and smooth, rich and creamy, and right point of the sweetness and sourness… can’t explain how good it was, and how happy I was when I had a sip of it.

Overall, this is a place I would recommend visiting if you are in Manchester. This place feels like the kitchen in your house (family atmosphere) It was quite crowded around 12:30, but there were still abundant seats.

---

Best hidden gem Indian food !! Such a good deal with massive portions :)

---

Nice cheap place for quick meal!

---

Have been going to This and That with my Mum since the 80's. We don't live in Manchester anymore so we always stop by when we're in town. I love the food here so much. Friendly warm and genuine place. You don't truly know Manchester until you've been here!!
Rice and three, great veggie food and meat options too.Great Value.

Please please do a This and That Recipe book!

---

Tried this place for the first time tonight after my partner raves about it and was honestly pleasantly surprised. I got the 2 meat and veg with a side of garlic naan and veg samosas. Good portion size and food was delicious. Will be definitely heading back to this little gem very soon.

---

Amazing food always the best curry in Manchester. Shout out to Mo always so accommodating. Little gem this place is.

---

Simply b-e-a-ootiful.

---

A no frills spot, serving excellent Indian food at a fantastic price. 'Rice and 3' at £7 provided a perfect lunch. Highly recommended.

---

This is great. Its simply rustic you queue up in a line and pick any 3 curries on a bed of rice for under £10.  They have a different set of curries each day loads of local office workers go.  You might be sharing a table bench with other people and when you approach from outside it look well shady but it great

---

Always excellent food

---

Been coming here on & off for years like many others. You can’t argue with the food for the price.

---

the absolute best way to describe this place is - you know walking home you smell some great cooking and you wish you could be invited in, but you arent and you go home and order a take out but its resturant food and not anything like the home cooking.... WELL THIS PLACE DOES INVITE YOU IN. IT IS THE GREAT HOME COOKED SMELL YOUR SMELLING. I kept hearing great things. From everyone from every walk of life. it is exceptional. everyone is welcome and everyone will love what they have cooked. Home cooked style. so incredibly good value. such amazingly kind and dedicated people.

---

Best curry in Manchester by a mile

---

Tucked away down a tiny back street is this gem. The food is simple & down to earth, with no frills, but it is absolutely top notch. You must go here. 👍

---

Always decent.

---

Never been here.!
Saturday august the 08th at Bolton train station at appx 10.30 pm. One of your staff kindly got us a cab to Bury and helped us out with some change to give to the taxi driver for our journey when we thought we didnt have enough.
Bravo to you my friend and will one day soon pay the same respect to you .
Thank you so very much you are a true gentleman.

---

not visited Manchester til you've had a rice n three from this place xx hehe

---

Quality food at a fair price

---

This place is a hidden gem,   get yourself down

---

Love this place so much l, the food is amazing the staff are super friendly. If I’m in this part of Manchester I’m 100% definitely going to eat here👌👌👌

---

We saw this restaurant on a YouTube “must visit in Manchester” and made a special trip.  No frills, extremely friendly staff (guessing most are family).  Genuinely interested in customers. Food was very tasty and will come again if we visit.  They run out of some items towards closing time so I would get there an hour before closing.  It’s off the main road down a lane so it’s a little hidden.  :)

---

Simplement incroyable ! Du service sans chichi a la qualité des plats ! A faire !

---

Great value curry and rice, plus Pedro does not visit here

---

Das Essen ist der Knaller. Super lecker und sehr herzliche Bedienung.
Es gibt eine täglich wechselnde Tageskarte von der man frei wählen kann.
Es ist kein Restaurant sondern mehr eine Art Imbiss, aber  100% zu empfehlen

---

Biblical Scran

---

Amazing food

---

This place is a hidden gem, they do a thing that I have only seen in Manchester (but I suspect has come from other places) called "rice and three". You have a plate of rice then you choose three of the set menu curries to put on top. They are all made very mild as you add your own chilli and coriander after you buy it. It is also cheap, no fancy trimmings, just a canteen vibe and lovely staff and excellent food. The menu is set and is at the end of the servers bar printed on glass, which shows you how much it doesn't change.

---

Totally superb place. If you want a tasty spicy curry, served quickly, then this is the place to visit. Great value for money too, and helpful service too for those with mobility problems. Portions were perfect.

---

Awesome curry cafe. Great friendly service and very tasty food, served up within a few minutes too. Went for the 3 meat option with rice, large portion.
Highly recommended.

---

The best restaurant on the planet.

---

Delicious currys. Can mix and match from all currys on offer. Really nice guy running it.

---

Great food, great staff and great price. What else can you say.

---

This place is mint. Swear down.

---

Hidden in a run-down alley, you'll find this gem. Great food and helpful staff.

---

Just brilliant. Tasty and cheap. Chef is a massive BWFC supporter too.

---

Awesome place, awesome food! Have been going here for years! Eat in and take out are both worth it :-)

---

Very tasty food in a ‘no frills’ environment which suited us fine. The staff were incredibly friendly and genuine. It came to £18 for three large plates of food, a Nan bread, onion barji and a coke!

---

Listen, you don't go there to sit fancy and enjoy the ambience.
You go there to get tasty authentic food and a service that lives up to its origin country.
Loved it.
Prices are cheaper, food is fresh and varies daily. Simply great.

---

Awesome lunch, "rice and three"

---

10/10 Proper hidden gem this place

---

Halal, cheap and large portion

---

Gotta say food is better here than most of restaurants I have ever tried! Really authentic flavours. Naan was light & fluffy. Really friendly service ❤️ wish this was in London

---

Absolutely fabulous! From the moment my friend and I walked in we were greeted with a warm welcome and a smile.  It was nearly closing time but that was not a problem to them at all.  We explained we had never been before and the lovely gentleman kindly said what they had to offer which was lamb mine curry, vegetable curry and chicken curry...... yes please!
A younger gentleman with a huge smile said, please sit down ladies and we'll bring it over.
Quickly or
Our food arrived again with a huge smile from a friendly chap who asked if we would like any breads with our food, again yes please!
Now I'm from Bradford known as the curry capital and I've eaten many, many curries from back street curries to Mumtaz and this was what I like to call an authentic curry.  So full of flavour, just delicious and at £7.50, well you can't beat it.
So please 🙏🏽 pop in for the warmest of welcomes and leave with the fullest of tummies and you will not be disappointed.

---

Great food!

---

They give us a great experience.  And you can be full with small price.

---

Best place to eat in manchester 10/10 👌🏼

---

If you want an authentic Indian curry..then this place is a must go! We LOVE the food from here... consistently amazing. Staff are always really friendly and helpful and we love the option of outside seating.

---

Great food at reasonable price.

If you want an authentic curry for lunch this is the place to go.
Tasty food, no frills, well priced.
Puts many up market Indian restaurants to shame.

Great curries and affordable too. Well worth a visit! No frills.

---

La comida es increíble, no puede ser mejor y más majos ellos.

---

Fantastic food at a reasonable price.

---

I love this place and don't get to go as often as I'd like, three different curry's and rice great value for money and very tasty. Different choice of curry's every day

---

The lunch was best for all!!!

---

Great taste for affordable price. Must try. Mango lassi is must try.

---

Lovely food and staff it's great when you cannot be asked cooking for 1 while hubby is away for work and can pick up comfort food on your way to work to make your night shift go quicker with good food see you soon

---

Best hotel I ever ate in Manchester. It serves authentic Indian food.

---

Great home made Indian food, simple and tasty

---

Love this place, decent food tucked away in a side street. Has been there for many years. Definitely recommend.

---

Cheap & cheerful but great curry.

---

Brilliant cheap and cheerful

---

Fantastic place to eat with all the family when in the NQ . Friendly, fast and really well priced. Great choice for meat eaters and veggies . I fed me and my son here with a hot healthy meal for less than a fast food takeaway !

---

Great Indian food with good flavour and authentic taste. Really hits the spot. They don't offer kids portion however. Would definitely go again

---

Authentic Asian food at affordable prices.

---

Superb 👍👍👍👍👍

---

Wow. What an amazing place. The food was absolutely spot on. The service was really good however the naan bread took a good few minutes to come out and we already had the curries so it was either wait and the food go cold or start and eat the bread without the food. The naan was cooked fresh so will know to order that first next time. There will definitely be a next time as the food was spot on as was the price.

---

We went this morning and had curry for our late breakfast!  It's great food and no fuss it was just what we needed after a great night in The Millstone!  It was a box we wanted to tick and we'll definitely go again when in town, oh and only £16 for both meals and a drink! 10/10

---

Lovely Indian food

---

Always fabulous food and great value. My go to place when in Manchester.

---

A hidden gem. Go visit!

---

Great lunch, highly recommend. Cantina style Indian , absolutely going back

---

A hidden gem! Amazing for a quick and relatively cheap meal right in the city centre that never lets you down

---

Incredible, some of the best curry I have ever had

---

I got to This & That every working day for a rice and three veg curry and a chapatti for £4.20 - it is amazing. I have been going for over 20 years and have never got bored! The decor is simple and functional but the food is amazing. Proper healthy curry like your mum would make! And the staff are friendly too. I can't recommend This & That enough :)

---

Amazing authentic food, friendly staff and great prices.

---

This place is always incredible. Love the food, the ambiance, the staff, the other diners. It's awesome. I come back as often as I can. You should too.

---

Food was amazing. Prices are reasonable. Didn't even know about this place been going since 1984. Will definitely be going again. Would also recommend this place 10/10

---

Authentic Indian style rice and verities of curry..served by experienced chef. good food in the heart of Manchester

---

An unpretentious little restaurant, easy to miss down an alleyway. Great tasting food and the staff were really friendly - the prices were very reasonable too.

---

Food is very delicious

---

Worth every penny spent. Awesome delicious hot Indian food. Highly recommended.

---

これまでに数度利用。店内の他にカレーとチャパティを2度持ち帰りました。以前インドに5年間住んでいましたが、此処の料理はスパイスは現地程強くしていませんが外れが無いです。店員の皆さんも概してフレンドリーで親切です。

---

I have found one of the best restaurant
In Manchester.

---

This was the first time I had visited This & That. My son always raves about it & insisted on taking me. All he did was tell me not to judge the place by what the premises look like outside. We visited on a Saturday evening and within 45 mins of closing. I have to be honest, on turning into Soap Street and seeing the restaurant front I didn’t hold out for much. On entering the premises there was a healthy amount of people sat down eating their food, as well as people queueing up to order. The servery looked like a school dinner counter, but well stocked with piping hot food. The lady who served us was very pleasant and advised us on what each dish was. I chose Chicken Tikka masala, Keema curry, chicken curry & rice, with a side of a garlic naan. I’m a spicy food lover, so was a bowl of pencil chilli’s to add to my dish.
We took our seats on the provided benches & tucked into our food. I have to admit that I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the food for the £7 we paid for our plate full. The food was lovely, the staff were all chatty & happy to engage in conversation & banter.
To summarise, don’t judge a place based on its appearance.
Thoroughly enjoyed my visit & will definitely go again.
The only negative I can think of, is that they have a Man U crest on the wall, which made me feel nauseous when eating. 😂😂

---

My favourite place. I go once a week. Friendly people and great vegan options

---

As good as it was 20years ago, just could do with a few mild curries getting a wimp in my 40s but always enjoy a blast when I visit Manchester from Bolton with my twin x

---

Great food and great value proper curry very tasty selection of any 3 with rice and chapati for £7 is a bargain 😁

---

Greasy Spoon cafe for curry. Whats not to love

---

Loved it. Food was very tasty 3 X meat curries and rice under £11. Definitely worth a visit.

---

Great tasting food and fantastic value.

---

Absolutely bangin’

---

The food was amazing, and the staff/owners were very helpfull, next time im in Manchester I will definitely return.

---

We went to 'This & That's yesterday (Friday) at around 3pm - instantly welcomed by the staff, and we were even given samples of the food to make sure it wasn't too spicy for us before we ordered. The food was incredible, and the service was first-class. A great little independent restaurant which deserves to be visited by anyone looking for authentic, great-tasting Indian food. 5-stars!

---

La vendedora de una tienda de ropa usada me recomendó este lugar al preguntarle por comida vegetariana y debo decir que al llegar a la calle pensé "¡qué callejón inmundo es este!", pero al entrar ya supe que estaba en el lugar correcto. Todos los currys son buenos, cambian todos los días y los precios son incomparables. Totalmente recomendable.

---

Struggling for a good curry rice in Manchester, tbh this is where we landed eventually and the food was so delicious, staff were polite and friendly and the overalls budget is quite decent as well. Kudos to the whole team, i would definitely give it more visits.

---

Hidden food gem of Manchester. Absolutely great curry and rice plate. Very good and authentic taste of Indian food with good quantity.

---

Fab food. Fab staff

---

Been going there for over 30 years and still to this day the best nihari I have ever had

---

No frills, small canteen type place serving delicious Indian food. Best lunch place for me, if you are looking for good quality and authentic Indian food.

---

I couldn’t ask more for what I got here, authentic Indian curry, great value and delicious. Very happy having this India cuisine in this diversity city.

---

Best Nihari

---

the original, rice and 3.

---

Just eaten here, late Friday afternoon. Table outside, service was friendly and efficient, food/value was 11/10. Unreal ❤️

---

Incredibly good value!

---

Absolutely perfect as usual. Yummy

---

Absolutely awesome food. Fresh and healthy. Would recommend any deshi(desi) people trying to find an unpretentious curry place that tastes gopd and budget-friendly.

Pro-tip: Chicken Masala and Spinach are spot on!

---

Amazing food for a very good price 👌🏽👌🏽👌🏽 dont be fooled by the basic set up and plastic chairs etc. This is a good meal served hot and fresh. Lovely.

---

Looks like a soup kitchen but 3 beautiful curries and rice for £8. Mint.

---

Great food, no frills. Friendly staff. Very affordable. Can’t go wrong.

---

맨체스터에서 경험할 수 있는 최고수준의 현지 맛집입니다. 영국 현지사람들이 계속 들어옵니다.
사장님이 아주 친절하고 유쾌함

---

Brilliant place. Incredibly tasty curry, sold as Rice and 3 different curry's from a choice of 6 or 7. Really lovely staff, I'm not sure I'll ever eat anywhere else in Manchester again! My wife and I had curry, rice, naan and a drink for less than £20. Amazing.

---

Amazing little place. Cheap with quality food and service

---

One of Manchester's best curry! I'm from Malaysia and there's no shortages of good curry around town but this place ranks as one of my top 3 in the world for good honest cheapest and delicious curry with rice. Good portions too!

---

Very nice place for bite to eat.

---

If you’re looking for no thrills, and a cheap and tasty meal that goes down easy, this is the place. Energetic bossman that always hooks me up with extras. A must-do for Manchester, whether it’s dinner or just lunch.
Menu changes every day.

---

tasty curry. nice people

---

The food here is so tasty! The street looks like you should just walk past it, you will be missing out on delicious indian food if you do. Enjoy.

---

Hidden gem 💎 🙏🏿🇮🇳
Got in, hella local ppl and the family attending the business. You already know food is about to be buzzing. That combination is some ~LeBron and D Wade for the Heat~ type shyt. Manchester weather is shyt, but the food in this place will make u forget about it.

---

Best curry in Manchester. Amazing portions, amazing prices, amazing flavours. Great veggie options. A must when visiting Manchester.

---

Wonderful home cooked food, spices just right and curry not swimming in oil. Certainly go there again.

---

Das This and That ist ein kleines indisches Juwel mitten im Northern Quarter. Unscheinbar in einer kleinen dunklen Sackgasse gelegen und innen weder schmuck noch einladend. Aber fast alle Tische waren besetzt und die Gäste sahen zufrieden aus.
Pro Tag gibt es eine Auswahl an verschiedenen vegetarischen Curries und welche mit Fleisch. Man kann entweder ein Curry wählen oder man wählt zweierlie oder dreierlei. Die Kosten waren wie sonst nirgendwo in Manchester - zwischen 6,50 und 7,50 Pfund für einen vollen Teller. Auf den Fotos sieht es nocht schön aus aber es schmeckt unfassbar gut und hausgemacht.

---

Delicious and affordable food!

---

THIS is the place youre looking for when lost for delish, cheap & tasty food. Dont forget the fresh green chilli garnish!

---

You will not believe how good the food is and how affordable the price is until you go there. Went there twice and food was awesome. It’s almost like a community dining space. And good food.

---

Great food! Always busy

---

this is one of Manchesters amazing hidden treasures. the food is great & it's cheap. has a lovely homely feel. cannot recommend this place enough it's such good value

---

I am going this place since 15 years and I love this place and food

---

Love this place! Great owners and we love the atmosphere inside. The food is always amazing.

---

Delicious food, generous portions and great value for money.

---

Wow! My husband normally has this with the lads at work as a treat on lates once in a while. As the Christmas holidays were upon us. I decided to sample it myself, with the husband tagging along of course ;) I think he would be furious if I left him out, as it is now one of his firm favourites. I have to say, I was completely sold from the first month full. Amazing quality, quantity and value for money. You don't often see those three words in the same sentence. I can't wait to try this again and sample some more delights.

---

Rice and 3 veg curries always a winner

---

Fantastic gem, should not be overlooked if you like curry

---

Great place, great food and value! A hidden gem

---

Best curry in Manchester!

---

This is a great little hidden gem of the Northern Quarter. Especially if you are on a budget and want a quality curry with veggie options always available. 👌

---

Can't express what a saviour this place is to have in the northern quarter when your low on funds. Perfect scran for any occasion and you almost don't want to show anyone in case more people come to it. Veggie options just as good as meat and I'll never say no to going.

---

The best nehari I have ever had . always on point and never disappoints

---

A really good & cheap Indian place. Everything's basically under £6. Amazing people, great service.

---

If you like a meal with rice and curry from the Indian subcontinent with an influence of local cuisine  ,then this place you should visit which is cheap and tasty. This place is a very simple, small eatery. They are serving rice and good non veg curries with naan since 1984. Thanks

---

i loved it so much! clean place, warm staff and DELICIOUS food. will definitely be going back often :)) a very wholesome and hearty meal

---

I had rice, beef keema, lamb nihari, and chickpeas takeaway. It was an amazing meal, and it cost me only £7. I would definitely come here again. The food was homely and delicious. The space was crowded because who wouldn’t want to come here and have this food?

---

Fantastic food, service, value for money

---

This & That Indian cafe

Located in the Northern Quarter down a back alley, This & That is a  family ran business which was established in 1984.
They offer a huge choice of curries, meat, veg and vegan options with a different choice Monday to Sunday.

All their food is homemade and prepared using fresh whole spices for an authentic taste and maximum flavour.

How the menu works:
vegan
Rice & 3 Veg: £4.50

Rice & 1 Meat & 2 Veg: £5.00

Rice & 2 Veg & 1 Karai: £5.50

Rice & 2 Meat & 1 Veg: £6.00

Rice & 3 Meat: £6.50 (+50p on Sun)

We went on a Sunday, you join the queue, very much canteen style, pick your 3 dishes, add any drinks or sundries and you're done! It's as simple as that. Service is friendly, food is tasty and portions are perfect.
It really is one of Manchester's hidden Gems and without any of this IG fuss. They don't even have IG 😎

If you really haven't tried This and That then you should consider going. You definitely won't be disappointed. We paid £17 including drinks & naan.

📍3, Soap St, The Northern Quarter, Manchester M4 1EW

Brilliant value food. Will be back soon 🙂

---

Great value for money - can try a few different currys that are on offer and the menu is always changing depending on the day of the week. Staff are friendly. It's definitely worth a try if you haven't been.

---

All I can say is that i genuinely can't enjoy food from other restaurants now I have eaten here, the only place I have ate curry in the last 4 years

---

The best 👌

---

Great service, great food! Nothing more to say - 11/10. 🤌

---

Delicious food, great value, nothing more to add!

---

Fantastic sport hidden away in Manchester.   Food here is authentic and very homely.  Around lunchtime it is almost impossible to find a place to sit.  it is cafeteria style sit down so you may sit with a few strangers.  You could take your food to go.  But this is definitely finger licking good for veg option or non veg option.

---

Always try to visit when I'm in Manchester. It's a very popular eatery and rightly so.  Their rice and 3 curries are heaven and reasonably priced. Long may it continue.

---

Perfect!

---

If you’re looking for a cracking curry at good value… this is the place.

A good range of selection which all exceeded expectation and perfect to go with a group.

Few quotes from the lads after:

“Still can’t get my head round how unreal that gaff was”

“Never judge a book by its cover”

“That is a place that knows how to curry”

---

Love This & That. My favourite curry house in Manchester.

---

Oh my days, what a hidden gem!!! It’s literally so easy to miss, it’s hidden away in the corner of a dark narrow street. We had rice and three meats: chicken tikka masala, lamb nih-something and keema - the minced beef. Everything was absolutely delicious, soft and melt-in-your mouth texture with incredible flavour. The place itself had a very canteen-like atmosphere with people sitting down with plates filled with food they got at the till. The naan was also great but not the best naan I’ve had. Also everything was priced so reasonably!! A plate of rice with three meats and a naan came to 9.80£. I’m most definitely coming back!!!

---

Love the food. Staff is really nice and caring. A place with history and rich flavours. Busy during lunch time.

---

Tried this place with my wife and veggie daughter we all loved the food the staff were very welcoming and friendly and was very reasonably priced £24 for all of us with nan bread is a bargain we are deffo going back

---

Nice little restaurant serving authentic Indian curries at reasonable cost.

---

Great prices for curry's cooked and served in front of you. Nothing posh but Great food.....

---

Can’t imagine a Manchester without This & That, been coming here years and it’s always been great. No nonsense, just brilliant quality traditional Indian food at an extremely generous price point. When after lunch or dinner in the city, for me the first choice is always here.

---

Great food, great service, great prices! Down a small street and maybe doesn't look much from outside, but don't let that put you off!

---

Best Indian food in Manchester

---

Probably the best dinner in Manchester considering the price

---

Great value curry cafe in the heart of the Northern Quarter.

---

No frills greatness

---

Just had rice and 3 meat. Fantastic. Last time was 1990. Still amazing value.

---

No frills, tasty filling food, and the price is more than reasonable.
Fully recommend for everyone to try once if they're in Manchester.

Squashed and a little uncomfortable, but the food is fabulous and very very cheap, for such a central location. Will be back, many times

---

Fantastic food,  genuine care and quality. Fast service too.  Small place but a jewel for taste and value. I plan to keep coming back here during my visit to Manchester.

---

I'd heard about This and That a few times, it's reputation proceeded it. I knew it was rice and three and canteen style. But I was a bit anxious about ordering as ihave anxiety and had never been before but the lady was lovely and explained to me which curry wss which. The food was delicious and hot and I paid £9.50 for my rice and three and a drink.

---

Best curry you will find in Manchester and for around £5, super authentic food, no fuss, quick, easy and spot on every time. I don't know anyone who has been and doesn't recommend.

---

Every time I eat here, it's the best curry I've ever tasted in my entire life.

---

Fabulous food at a good price

---

Homely Rice and Three for a decent price.

---

Don't worry too much about the atmosphere.. food is great... Simple.. and straight forward

---

Very rustic simple joint... Great spot

---

Small place with delicious homestyle curries. There's a rotating menu that changes every day, which helps to maintain better quality of the food. Would recommend

---

Delicious food made by the same family since 1984. Friendly, welcoming staff,  generous portions around a fiver. A hidden gem.

---

Amazing

---

If you are missing the home cooked meal at the heart of Manchester then look no more. One of the best selections of quick rice bowls.

Awesome food, no shinny decor just brilliant food and at super low prices.

Przepysznie i tanio jak na Anglię i chyba nawet Polskę. Polecam

Very good affordable food, highly recommend.

---

Cheap, fresh and excellent Indian food indeed! Would recommend 100%

---

This place is no doubt the best and most authentic indian food there is in the entire Manchester or maybe UK. If you’re not scared of spice, come to this place. It might not have the best interior and setup but come here for food and not for vibe! Just the flavors and spices make up for everything! Totally would eat here everyday if I can.

---

Friendly staff male this place even better!

---

Amazing food

---

Excellent

---

Best scran in Manchester.

Awesome food, excellent place.

One of the best places to eat on the cheap in Manchester. Large portions and great curry, I go all the time.

---

If you don't know this place then I urge you to find it. It's sooo good 👍👍👍👍👍

---

The best curry place in Northern Quarter and, possibly, in town. Must not be missed.

The claim is correct. A hidden gem. Well worth seeking out.

Disappointment unknown!

Fun little place. Great Indian food, cheap with free yogurt and opens till 8pm everyday.

---

Brilliant place, great selection and seriously good value, the food is superb

---

Absolutely amazing X

---

Incredible spot. Just went there the one time, but had really tasty curry for an unbeatable price. The service was good and you can tell this place is very authentic, no attempts to be hip or trendy. Great on vegetarian/vegan options too!

---

Solid homely Indian food at a good price point

£5.50 for 2 meats and a veg

Tap water is free

Do note it's cash only!

---

Amazing cheap food

---

food is absolutely fabulous  difficult to find if you don't know it

---

The best hands down

---

This is what a curry house should be, no nonsense good honest food. Absolute gem tucked away off the beaten track, decent veggy options and a glass of mango lassi to die for, all for about 8 quid. I took a friend of mine there who writes for lonely planet and he was blown away by its value for money.

---

Oh my word what an absolute winner of a cheeky curry lunch 😋. Rice and 3 curries at its finest, little back street place that you would miss unless you knew it existed.  I got there soon after opening and it had already started filling up. Great food, great staff. Next time in Manchester have a nose,you know uou want to 🫡

---

Used to come here for a bi-weekly lunch treat with my colleagues. Absolutely delicious curries, friendly staff and good atmosphere in general. Sets you up for the rest of the day nicely👌🏻

---

A Manchester favorite for a reason banging curry at a nice price

---

Brilliant food, hidden away, well worth hunting it down.

A Manc institution and quite rightly so. Great food, great prices.

Great value high quality food served simply and with a smile 😊

---

Friendly welcoming staff,
Lovely food as always.

---

The best in Manchester

---

What can I say? No frills but unbelievable value. 4 curries and rice on one plate for £5.50. We arrived at 16:15 and had the same choice as on the menu. Fresh cooked rice whilst we waited. Friendly staff who certainly know how to make you welcome. Huge portions at low prices, I'll be back next time I'm oop north!!

---

Outstanding quality and quantity. Got there at quarter past 4 on Monday on our way to the Iron Maiden concert. A full, and I mean full, plate of 4 curries with rice for £5.50. It's no frills but it doesn't need any, the food speaks for itself. Quite tricky to find, but worth persevering for.  I'll be back.

---

Best secret back alley place in Manchester!

---

Great place, tooked away but well worth a visit. Not a lot of frills but the food is fantastic.

---

Amazing food and staff the original three currys and rice venue. Would highly recommend the foods exception for the price.

---

Exceptional food *****

---

Delicious meal, friendly staff and buffet deals
Dine with the wanderers and get the chills

---

Manchesters hidden gem

---

Decent Indian food place

---

Hidden gem of Manchester. Variety of dishes for vegetarians and non-vegetarians. The food served is fresh and hygienic. The atmosphere of the place is very good and the staff is very polite and friendly. The place is usually busy during lunch and dinner times, if you are looking for cheap and wholesome food options just go for it. Although the vegetarian curry mostly includes potatoes so check the menu for the day first to avoid disappointments.

---

Great range of currys at reasonable prices. A Manchester institution that must be tried.

---

Fabulous hidden gem on Soap street tucked away down the alleylike near bus terminal in Manchester. Rice and 3, the way to go for the modern curry lover. Love this place. Fantastic food. Enjoy!!!

---

Super

---

Went looking for a good Indian restaurant in Manchester and after reading some reviews and looking around settled on This and That. Was not disappointed, the food was excellent and quick with cheap prices. As well the staff were extremely friendly and welcoming. Will definitely be attending again soon.

---

Best curry in Manchester, fantastic value for money

---

This and that is the best curry I’ve ever had, I will willingly travel 30 mins by train and walk into the centre of Manchester just to get this curry, they have excellent meat and vegan options and all there food comes with unlimited toppings

---

Garlic naan, lamb, mango lassi, I left the airport to eat here before catching a flight in a few hours because of the great reviews I heard about here. I admire his us of a walkie talkie!

---

Very good food
Service 5 star

---

Tried the Wednesday menu. Some of the best South Asian food I've eaten in recent memory (beware though, can be spicy for some)! The mango lassi and the garlic naan were both also delicious and highly recommended. Absolutely fantastic food and taste, at an incredible price and served with a smile and great attitude from the staff - thanks Mo and team! Excellent model of restaurant and I wish you another 40 years of success and beyond. What a hidden gem that I will forever recommend to everyone!

---

Really great curry for £4!

---

Muy rico el curry, sitio muy curioso.

---

Wow. Dank food, when they brought dusky on it took it to another level.

---

Does what it says on the tin - cheap and tasty curry for a quick lunch.

---

All the food was too spicy for me, but the vibe and service were great! I liked it that they were honest in telling me it's spicy, but also gave me a small sampling dish to see if I could handle it. It was so nice of them and I appreciate it. If I had more tolerance for spices, I'd definitely eat there often. Prices are also great, especially for the amount given.

---

You dont just come here for their food..but the hospitality too. Heartwarming people serving hot dishes, rain or shine..just This and That. Yum!!

Best indian food in Manchester. Affordable and tasty.

---

Very nice atmosphere and very tasty food at an affordable price. Service with a smile. I am glad my friend took me there "This & That" really is a hidden gem in Manchester.

---

Great

---

Awesome food at reasonable price.

---

Curries are very good and quite cheap.

---

Gleich vorab, der Laden ist zum Essen und Stärken da und mehr nicht. Dafür schmeckt es, vegane Option ist möglich und das Personal ist sehr freundlich. Die Locals gehen hier Mittag essen.

---

Good food, friendly staff, and quick service! Best keema naan & daal on the planet!

---

Very decent and tasty. Not for a fancy night out, but good quality and price for a quick meal!

---

After living in Manchester for 11 years and this and that being my favourite restaurant for the entire time - I thought I should probably write a review. Honestly this place never misses, I could eat here everyday. Unique and such great value for money. Will argue with anyone that there is nowhere better to eat!

---

Amazing Indian curry!! Must eat if you’re visiting Manchester!!

---

Strongly recommend this peculiar place. Long shared tables, vibrant atmosphere of diverse characters, and great food at a very reasonable price. The host is super friendly and kind.

---

Best rice & three in the Northern Quarter. Simple.

---

Cannot speak more highly of this place and the owners. Went after hearing nothing but good things about “Manchester’s hidden gem” which boats the best curry in town. Blown away by not just the quality of the food, but how nice the owners were. After hearing it was my first UK curry experience, they were kind enough to give me extras to try, letting me experience it all.

Didn’t want to post this review because I want to keep it all to myself but it’s a must visit in Manchester for food, atmosphere, and just good people

---

Really incredible Indian food. Nothing fancy, but fast, delicious, filling, and very affordable! 3 delicious currys and a plate of rice for 8 pounds.

Cannot recommend enough if you are here. Definitely a hidden gem 💎

---

A Manchester institution, been coming here for over 15 years and never once had a bad meal. Just consistently fantastic food, simple and effective, no messing about. Eating in or taking away, love it.

---

I've only been coming here since 1990... I love it.

---

I Love this place ! It is Indeed a true hidden Gem in Manchester ! £8 pound for rice and 3 meat currys, they have a great selection everyday there are many vegetarian options too. Very authentic and exceedingly tasty ! You can also pick up freshly made sundries and Onion bhajis for cheap. You have to give this Gem a try !

---

Great everything, well worth the visit

---

Awesome and cheap curry house. Delicious curry deals for a great price. Always a favourite when I'm in the centre

---

Already made curry dishes. Got tasty and fresh. Not spicy but sauces available. Good value and quick

---

Amazing place highly recommend the food best place ever

---

Best back street food in the world

---

It's not about the atmosphere, it's about a Manchester institution and good curry. The rice and three is good value and very tasty. Been coming for decade's and will continue to.

---

Wonderful staff, great value for money. Really enjoyed the food, the naan was one of the best I’ve had. Hope to be back soon!

---

Superb curry and naan bread

---

Great food, excellent value, lovely people 👏👏👏

---

My favourite restaurant so far in Manchester

---

Fantastic, good, cheap food

---

Absolutely love the nihari , meat and creamy the way I like it and not to fatty as the option is given to put oily bone marrow on top or not, I recommend with roti , also the lamb spinach is really nice as well , been twice now in the last two weeks and really enjoyed the food and experience.

---

Ok, it's not posh, it's basic but the food is fab! Great value for money, great authentic curries.. and you get rice and a choice of 3 different curries to go with it, with a great selection too.. love coming here when in Manny.

---

Great food, relaxed atmosphere, great price

---

Obsługa bardzo sympatyczna, jedzenie wydawane prawie natychmiastowo.
Jedzenie smaczne, nawet duże porcje.
Zamówiliśmy chicken tikka masala, curry chicken, czosnkowe chlebki naan i samosę i zapłaciliśmy £17.

---

10/10. The Dahl was incredible as were all the vegi curries. Bargain of a meal and such a big portion!

---

Amazing concept / service, and a great variety of curries. Reasonably priced too!

---

Wow wotta hidden gem in Manchester.. This place never disappoints. First n foremost this is a PAKISTANI food n a PAKISTANI restaurant not Indian as it states in the description. PAKISTANI 🇵🇰 remember the name..

EXCELLENT FOOD N GREAT CHOICE OF DISHES

---

Really lovely food, just the right amount of spice and chilli heat and the service was so friendly - they kept offering us extra food and chatted about football. 100pc recommend!

---

注文システムが分かりやすく、美味しい。ラムカレーを頼んだが、無料トッピングできた玉葱とパクチーをかけたら尚、美味だった。

---

Outstanding hidden gem in the middle of Manchester Town centre
Good original cuisine
Very popular and always busy

---

So I've been meaning to come here for a few months now after seeing a social media post about it.
I wasn't disappointed! Such amazing food in a friendly vibrant atmosphere!! Next stop will be with the family ❤️

---

Was such a nice experience and the person who was behind counter was excellent gave chaat on the house. Food was delicious

---

Wow Unbelievable the service and food was amazing

---

Awesome food , desi memories 😋

---

Good food quality and service.

---

Everything in the menu is tasty. Fast service, reasonable price, good taste, easy dine in.

---

Nice hidden gem with halal food. Great portion, great flavor with cheap price. Highly recommend for food lover who like curry in their life.

---

5 star ! Wet day in Manchester just what I needed £7.50!

---

heard so much about this place and finally managed to find it. on first looks it seems like a place not to be trusted but this family business is amazing and has so many multiple food awards and once you taste the food you know why that is so you don't mind paying that slightly higher price. The portion sizes are great and the I always get the the same dish and its just perfect and you can tell others are enjoying them selves too. great atmosphere of everyone loving food and its one of very few places where I have seem so many people from different ethnic backgrounds go and enjoy the same food. PERFECT

---

Lovely little spot, quick service, easy business, straight up, pick your 3 curries dumped on a fluffy mountain of nice rice, then dress it however you want, coriander, onions, xtra green chillies, take your pick and gobble it down. £8 bosh. Canteen /school dinner vibe seating, very very good and very very nice come on ladies come on ladies 8 pound curry

---

for vegetarian curries
this is the place

---

Delicious curry, super cheap! I payed £4.50 for 3 small helpings of veg curry and rice.  It was very filling.

---

Delicious, home cooked style.
Great service every time.

---

This is genuinely my favourite Indian place in the city. Their food is so delicious and they give extremely generous portions! The guys who work there are also such sweethearts and always make me feel so welcome, I love coming here ❤️

---

Very good and rich taste of food. One of the few places, where you can find such flavourful food. All the curies are really good. In the heart of Manchester, almost in the middle of City Center, next to the Manchester Arndale, but still some times hard to find, Manchester's Hidden Gem for many reasons. There three cury snd rice is something in which you can get different flavours, spices and a mix of veg and meat. So, what else you can ask for in a single meal in such a reasonable price. You are going to find such good food, in a place you least expected. What else you can ask for. And it is there for decades since 1984.
Highly recommended if you like to have authentic Indian/desi food.

---

One of the best places for curry

---

Rice and lamb curry. Honestly say no more...😋

---

The best Indian food in Manchester city center

---

All ways fresh  food  you can get from thus place

---

Delicious Indian Curries 👌🏻 Highly Recommended

---

Lovely owners, very good food and halal. Gujirati owners too

---

Excellent food been going there since 1980s.

---

Perfection on a plate.

---

A true hidden gem!

---

Fresh nice tasty, no fuss meals great prices..

---

No fuss, no frills, great food

---

Homely Indian food. Eat everyday!

---

Authentic

---

The most indistinctive curry house ever, but the food is delicious, and also this must be one of the cheapest places in Manchester.

---

Good food and friendly service, in a pastiche of a 1980s Manchester that is -in large part - now just a memory. Wed 27Aug2025.

---

Can't be beaten for really good, value curry. I had rice with chicken tikka masala, lamb, spinach, a bhaji and a drink for tenner.

---

It might not be the best Indian food emporium on the planet, but it's certainly in the top one

---

Nice food, good value. The three curry and rice option, is well worth trying if you visit Manchester.

---

So cheap and tasty.

---

A very cozy place where to eat the delicious and famous Curry 3.
must try!

---

Fabulous hidden gem in the Northern quarter. Proper Asian cuisine, and cheap as chips!

---

Loved this place! Cash only. Good food. Very cheap.

---

The food is very good, you can choose from a menu and pick between rice, protein and vegetables. The prices are very good as well , very recommended if you’re on a budget but still enjoy eating well

---

The hidden gem of Manchester, if you're wanting frills then this isn't the place for you, but if you're wanting good decent food at a very good price then this is the place to go. We chose the 3 meat with rice for £8, we got keema and peas, chicken curry and chicken tikka and a plain naan for £1.50, all tasted amazing, perfectly cooked and very filling.
The real testament was how busy it is, the guy next to us said it was his third time this week, another said 2nd time this week.
If you're in Manchester this place is worth the visit.

---

The definition of a fast food, if you are hungry and want cheap good food that you don't have to wait for, try this place.

---

Hidden gem. In the small alley, amazing tasting food. The rice with 2 meat 1 vegetable was my choice and it was delicious. Chicken and beef and the chickpeas were very flavorful. The mango lassi was an added delight.  Very reasonable low price for Manchester.

---

Don't be put off by the front entrance, this is truly a hidden gem! The food is superb and riduculously good value!!! Wouldn't hesitate to recommend!

---

Simply incredible.

---

Institution. One of the best rice and 3 going and it's got great competition.

---

Great place

---

Great value tasty food, with a good range of meat and veg options. Friendly staff!

---

Best Indian food I've had in the UK, and the cheapest. (<£5)

Super friendly, kind, and gentle staff, tons of delicious food, extremely good value, lots of options to choose from.

---

Excellent curries, a 30- year old Northern Quarter legend for a good reason. There is a good selection of both vegetable and meat curries, with 3 curries on rice costing between 4-6£, it's value for money and absolutely delicious to boot. And the portions huge as well, what's not to love?! :))

---

Amazing curry for a good price! Came here recently returning as a meat eater and it was so good (previously only ate Vege options which are really good). Simple set up with a family/ local vibe. If you are missing Asian style curry this is one of the best places to go in the city.

---

Best rice and 3 in town

---

Wow what a nice little find. The food is amazing. The safe was fevy friendly and helpful.  I will definitely recommend the food. Will definitely be going again

---

Delicious curry, cheap, good portions. The people are nice and friendly and I love the atmosphere there.

---

אוכל ממש טעים וזול, באמת הכי זול שאפשר לאכול ולשבוע בעיר היקרה הזאת :)

---

Fantastic and incredibly affordable Indian food with wonderful, friendly and very attentive staff! 10/10 would eat here again.

---

Best Indian restaurant in manchester a true hidden gem 💎

---

Great food, good vibe

---

This place is really special - and one of the 10 oldest restaurants in Manchester.

---

Can't fault this place at all. Maybe not everyone's cup of tea but it's extremely popular and I took notice of the clientele to whom this place serves. There were people who were obviously office workers, construction workers, people who were eating before a night out and people who lived locally. I could go on...
The atmosphere is so friendly, as are the staff. Very well organised and the owner was very astute and was very apt at serving and treating people from all walks of life with an air of humanity that made it a warm environment; brought people together.
I took some photos a couple of weeks back and he came out, invited me in and made me feel welcome with an offer of some food. He said I could take some photos inside the premises - which I did.
I asked a few of the customers what they thought and they all said it was a great place and that the food spoke for itself.
I told the owner I'd be back and I took my friend with me.
The set up is a series of benches and tables, reminiscent of a School dining hall, with little decor but don't let that put you off.
I thought at first that the portions were a bit small but I was fooled. You get a healthy portion and we were given what we left - which was pretty much a full third meal.
The place is hidden down a side street and you'd wonder how it would thrive as a business but as you can see from my review,  that's how it advertises itself.
It certainly 'is' a hidden gem in a busy part of The Northern Quarter, Manchester.
It's a takeaway too and I noticed a lot of people using it as such.
What I would say, is if you want a five star candlelit romantic dinner, then this isn't the place for you - but if you want Indian food and a humble but warm environment, then this is your place.
The food does speak for itself by the way.
I personally couldn't fault this place and as a regular Manchester Photographer, I'll always stick my neck out to advertise this place 😁

---

Absolutely delicious food. Lovely warm atmosphere, great, fast service and incredible value for the quality of the food.

---

Hands down, the best vegetarian curries in Manchester also the cheapest I have found. They cycle through different dishes throughout the week so you get something a little different from one day to the next. Yum yum in my tum!

---

Without a shadow of a doubt, the greatest curry house in Manchester.

---

Just Ace.

---

My favourite affordable lunch/dinner spot. Right in the center of the chaos that is Manchester's vibrant Northern Quarter. Brilliant vegan options with a different menu every day. Owners a cheerful chap. Highly recommend!!!

---

Best curry in Manchester.

---

Best curry in Manchester for under 7 quid.

---

Amazing place - £7 for massive delicious curry in Manchester city centre

---

Such good value for money. Really good for a quick meal. The staff are also really nice and helpful

---

Veramente buonissimo, per un pranzo veloce sia che siate turisti ma anche se siete local, consigliatissimo e buon rapporto qualità prezzo

---

I've been a regular for over 26 years, simply amazing.

---

Another top notch scran at Manchester's finest R&3! Honestly got nothing bad to say the place at all, great food, great staff & great atmosphere. Barely a tenner for the R&3, Roti & a Meat Samosa. Fantastic value!

---

Amazing. More food than you can eat for under a fiver!? And all delicious!? Sign me up. I've been here a few times and the choice of the rice and three is always great. 10/10.

---

Hidden gem in Manchester!

Great value and approachable family running the restaurant. Highly recommend.

---

Used to go here about 10 years ago, great spot and doesn't look like the prices have gone up much since then.

---

Excellent curries in casual restaurant. Generous portions. I would eat here at least once a week if I lived here. Can't recommend strongly enough.

---

Quick, delicious and friendly!

The fact that it’s so cheap is just blimmin fantastic!

---

I wanted a curry while in Manchester for a few days with a mate.  Not gonna lie, don't know the area. Read some reviews and found this place. Food was great, good portions for eat in and take out. The guys in there were friendly. Different selections of food each day. Mango lassi is awesome. Outside communal seating in the street only adds to the experience. Recommended.

---

I really enjoyed it. Is a very simple indian place with home mad currys meals. They all taste good and seems to be cooked in an authentic way. There is a menu which changes for every day of the week. For the quality is absolutely cheap

---

Heard great things about This and That for years and even know the Casual Connoisseur twins who designed a T shirt in homage to their frequent trips to the place. Well worth hunting out (I ended up having to stoop to an all time low and speak to a traffic warden for directions, it's down alley by Trof in NQ) great food and flavours and not overly hot, great friendly service and a great price, what's not to like. Kids really liked it to and daughter not that fussed about Indian food usually. Will certainly be going back at some point.

---

Simply, Fantastic !!!
Came here on a flying visit to Manchester after seeing a review vlog by the MacMaster. Both my friends & I were blown away by the fabulous delicious home cooked food, friendly hospitable service, great value for money & basic but relaxed dining experience. We thoroughly enjoyed our visit to the This & That & next time in Manchester this is definately where I will be dining. Although different from the restaurant food most folk will be used to, I have to say that this traditional home cooked buffet style dining is in every way preferable to me,, it is proper indian food, just as it should be & I cannot wait to go back.
Thank you to all at the This & That,,,, it was way beyond my expectations 👍🤗

Just been here again. Same story, it was great.

---

Very nice rice and three. Great price.  Will be back . Would recommend. Excellent

---

Excellent as always, first visited in 1988 truly Manchester's hidden Gem. I visit at every opportunity. 🤗

---

Always great!!!

---

Great value, good atmosphere

---

Absolutely stunning great curries at a great price and a warm and friendly welcome and experience what's not to like

---

This is a great little play in the middle of town (Manchester) no fancy decor but the food is great and that's what matters. Been going since 1984 and always busy. Rice and three is big on the menu that's rice and 3 different curries. I'd recommend this place to anyone.

---

Manchester legend. The OG rice & 3. Great food, great prices!

---

Wow - what a place - a different selection of dishes served up each day of the week. It’s Friday - I had the Chicken Chan, Daal, Mixed Veg & Rice all for the remarkable price of £6.50! Fast efficient service - surely Canteen style dining at its finest?

---

Delicious. Great value. Friendly!

---

Doesn't look much from outside but wow this food is amazin. Got tikka massala, lamb spinach bombay potatoes an rice. Was absolutely beautiful can't say anything bad about this place. I'll be visiting every time I'm in Manchester. Also very clean inside including bathrooms. 👌

---

Probably the best curry cafe in Manchester. Certainly one of the longest established. I have been coming here for 30 years. First under the ownership of Iqbal, then under Mr Maloo, the same standards of cuisine have been maintained. Rice and three curries is the staple fare during Mon to Sat; the menu items differ each day. Sunday sees the best dish of all though - nehari. A sublime slow-cooked lamb dish. All done for keen prices. Highly recommended.

---

Consistently marvellous

---

No frills however good food, lunch for around £6 albeit you will eat too much

---

Top quality authentic no frills dining experience. Slightly tricky to find, down an alleyway, but well worth it. Three curries and rice. You can't go wrong.

---

Tasty good value curry house.  Friendly service

---

Best place for quick freshly made food. The lamb Nahari on Sundays is better than any I've had before.

---

Not the prettiest, but the best Curry house in Manchester!!! A must try...

---

Along time favourite that never disappoints.

---

A true authentic hidden gem. If you're looking for a dead posh restaurant this isn't the place for you. If you want honest food served with a smile however, this hidden gem does not disappoint.

---

Great and authentic tastes in reasonable price. Good for a quick lunch

---

Nice food and good portion. Owner is very attentive and kind.

---

Non siate spaventati dal di fuori! 😁soltanto entrate e gustate! La cucina è molto semplice ma è sensazionale, speziata e saporita e lo staff è gentile e disponibile! ---> Don't be scared from the outside! 😁 just enter and enjoy. The cuisine is very simple but amaizing, spiced, and tasty and the staff was superpolite.

---

Nos super encanto, plato grande y puedes combinar!!! Base de arroz y 3 tipos de carne. Super rico

---

Delicious and very cheap Indian food. A little hard to find.  Gets crowded, especially with students.

---

Great

---

Nice little restaurant with authentic food and super nice people. You can’t really see the place from the next bigger street but it’s existing and great! 👍🏼

---

Really tasty curries, great price and toppings for free.
Can't ask for more
Insanely good price must be kept a little secret ;)

---

Back here for the first time this Century, accompanied by a 20 year old daughter i didn't even have back then!  Spent nearly every lunchtime of my early working life here and its great to see the spirit and food hasn't changed one bit.  Still the best - Daughter was equally impressed.

---

Einfaches Ambiente bei großartiger Küche und kleinem Preis. Sehr empfehlenswert!

---

Cheap and delicious. My fab place in MCR.

---

Consistent high quality food and cheap prices. Friendly service, too. Absolutely recommended 👍

---

Hidden gem as other people have said, I've now been here a few times and have always found it to be friendly and welcoming, the concept is simple, choose two or three dishes, with rice. Everything is cooked fresh and is piping hot too, the spiced keema is really nice... Definitely one to recommend for a reasonably cheap meal out.

---

Very nice food and service

---

I've been going here since I was a baby and it will forever continue to be a hidden gem of amazing food, great service and fabulous prices.
If you like mango lassi - this place is the gold standard for it.

---

Exceptional food, great prices and even better staff. My favourite spot to grab dinner in NQ - they don’t make curries like this in Toronto.

---

Icarus saw a YouTube video from GaryEats reviewing this café that has been here for 40 years. Decided to give it a go. Tucked away down a side alley it is easy to miss. The rice plus three curries ranges from £6 for 3 veggie dishes to £8 for three meat dishes. (Or have one selection 3x!)  The choice of 8 or 9 dishes is set by day. Chicken curry and Keema seems to be on the menu every day. The lamb dish varies. There is a fish dish one day and a lamb and kidney on a Wednesday. Had two meals, a good naan and a can of coke for £20. All very good. A sociable shared eating space. Really enjoyed Ic buying our meal as his Advent Calendar Christmas present. Hard to find better value.

---

I think I've eaten here more than anywhere else in town. Highly recommended. Great options for veggies and vegans.

---

Best place to eat in Manchester City centre

---

best curry i’ve ever had, can’t recommend enough

---

No frills just honest tasty food

---

First time eating there it was absolutely gorgeous definitely go there again

---

This place is a hidden gem! Definitely pay a visit if you can find it, such good value for money and lovely staff! Veggie options are also so tasty (£6 for a veggie meal) and portion sizes are great.

---

好吃！

---

A Manchester institution, been going to This and That for 20 years and will keep going. Firstly amazing value, can't get better for less. Good variety of delicious curries and always a great atmosphere. My first recommendation to anyone visiting Manchester

---

Absolute go tonight you're wanting a high quality, frugal bite to eat in the city centre. This is a frequent place my other half and I go locally.
I can highly recommend this place, and the Tikka and Daal are particularly good.

---

The best curry in Manchester!

---

Delicious, inexpensive, great place to grab lunch, even if you are in a hurry.

---

Great quality food and so cheap

---

Delicious thali and the kindest staff! They saw me enjoying the excellent mango lassi and my plate of food and gave me an extra glass and bowl of each when I finished - don't just come here for the tasty food and great prices (£1.50 lassi!), come for the lovely and thoughtful people who work here.

---

Absolutely love this place! Even though it can get super busy, I like that it still feels like a local secret and unless you go searching for it, you’ll hardly ever just stumble upon it!
The vegan/vegetarian cabbage dish and the chicken tikka masala are must haves when available, very delicious!
All vego curries are also vegan and to my knowledge, ALL curries are gluten free!

---

The best curry in the world.

---

Cheap, fast, beautiful food and great staff.

---

Superb

---

Delicious curry, probably the best  in Manchester, naan bread was excellent fluffy tasty better than the ones you get from takeaway restaurants.

---

Super!
Buonissimo e conveniente, serve riso o pane indiano con 3 condimenti vegetariani o con carne. Il posto ideale per una pausa pranzo veloce in puro stile Manchester!

---

One of the best rice and curry you will get in Manchester City Center with affordable price. If you go in the weekdays you find the crowd which says the taste of the restaurant. Highly recommend

---

Hidden food gem in the heart of Manchester, traditional rice and three toppings, absolutely delicious and absolutely Manchester. You haven't seen Manchester unless you have been here, so what are you waiting for?

---

Lovely, honest food

---

Amazing delicious food and amazing friendly staff and service. 100% everyone should go here!

---

Quick, tasty hot food👏🏾 what more could you want!

Visited here with my partner for food after shopping around town. We’d seen a lot of positive reviews and we both love curries so thought why not. It was quite busy inside once we arrived but we found a table fairly quickly. The decor isn’t up market but for the price of the meal, you can’t expect the ritz. Customer service was fair and quick too.

Now let’s talk food! The curries weren’t spicy enough for our taste, but they do have a self help onion, chilli and coriander bowel next to the till if you want to add more spice and flavouring. The lamb was really good and so was the chicken. Portions were big with a huge serving of rice underneath the curries. We also ordered vegetable samosas which were really good. However the garlic naan we ordered tasted funny with an artificial bright yellow colouring to it. We wouldn’t order it again and will opt for a plain naan.

Overall it’s definitely my new go to curry spot after a busy day of shopping or work. It’s perfect solo, with a partner or with friends. There’s something for everyone.

---

amazing food and nice staff

---

Absolutely amazing shop, top Quality products and service.

---

Homemade rice and three at a great price. Basic inside but quick service and clearly loved by locals.

---

So glad I called in to try after reading about this place. I only wish we had something similar up in the Newcastle area. Absolutely fantastic food and great value for money too

---

Cheap, delicious, and has vegan options.

---

This is our all time favourite spot in the city. Cheap and cheerful, food is great as are the portions. Always busy which makes the atmosphere and also says it all. Can’t go wrong!

---

A great  Manchester Institution! Serving inexpensive meals to city office workers for more years then many wish to remember. Eating here has become a 'rights of passage'   for many. Handy for the Arndale & Northen Quarter.

---

This is a tiny, genuinely homely little Eatery! The Nihari dish is just to Die for! It's so tiny, it only seats about 20 people (if that!) in one sitting and yet it's ALWAYS busy, full and popular. A little hard to find if you don't already know where it is as it's down the back alleys of Manchester, near Shudehill. If you do find it, tho', you're in for a TREAT! Looking for this little Jewel is like going on a a Treasure Hunt and it is the Treasure! Well worth finding!

---

It gets said a lot, but it really is Manchester’s best kept secret. It’d be worth moving to Manchester for
I’ve been popping here for just over 20 years). The food is always so fresh and delicious and service is cheerful and prompt. Price wise, for a city, it’s fantastically cheap (3 curries and rice for £7.50? Incredible!) And those onion bhajis? Oh my days! Get me there now!

---

Great food, friendly service and incredible value!

---

Fantastic food and staff. I should keep this place a secret but that wouldn't be a kind thing to do.

---

What an absolute gem. Great friendly staff and the most amazing authentic food. Cracking value for money. Curry, 2 chapatti and a drink ..£10. Amazing. Food was delicious. Nice atmosphere and absolute must!!!

---

Shhhhhhh! Don't tell anyone. Love this place ❤

---

I love this place more than I love my own family. the food is delicious and fresh everytime, it's the most affordable and tastiest curry in manchester. in my opinion friday is the best day to visit.

---

Fantastic food, just avoid peak dinner time as you will be queuing outside - that's how popular it is and well deserved! Great value meals with the famous rice and three curries.

---

Excelente comida y trato al cliente. Volveré

---

Been coming here for over 20 years. Cheap eats but the quality is incredible. Get the veg rice & 3 and top with a load of corriander

---

Great food, quick and cheap.

---

Love this place

---

Tried for the first time today, and absolutely loved it! one of the best places to eat in manchester, well worth the money and more and extremely friendly staff! can't wait to return again soon!

---

Just as I remembered from the early nineties. Food just as good and a nice variety every day. Thursdays are a good day.

---

Excellent value, good food. A hidden gem.

---

Delicious and inexpensive Indian street food! I tried few different curries and all were fantastic.

---

No frills great food

---

Amazing curries for a fair price with lovely people in a chilled atmosphere

---

Very good food coupled with good value.  A true gem in the Manchester scene with friendly staff and service

---

Excellent curries,  good price,  friendly service.

---

Good value for money. The meal is huuuge as well. Definitely recommend!

---

Place is abit sketchy other than that food was amazing! Loved their lamb korma! Would definitely recommend!

---

Best curry around. Staff are legends. Always come here and always will go back

---

Absolutely phenomenal place to visit with family or friends, your go to indian restaurant for sure! very welcoming and friendly staff. Customer service was 10 out of 10 if I could give more than five star I would. Really tasty food not had this kind of food in years. Will definitely recommend to family and friends and Will be my go to place from now on. Thank you once again. Much appreciated for your great service. Couldn’t be more happier

Keep up the good work #This&That ❤️ 🥘

---

Amazing food, great people, love it.

---

Sensational cheap eat curry spot.
9 curries on the go.
Three curries and rice with a can of pop for under a tenner, right in the city centre.
Fancy, it is not. Proper decent social spot.

---

best curry in manchester! came back twice for this. awesome food at great price!

---

Ridiculously good prices for such good food in the center of Manchester. People running it are super nice

---

Highly recommended! Freshly cooked daily, you'll want to go back, amazing price!

---

Best restaurant in Manchester! Delicious, clean and affordable prices

---

I’ve just decided I’m having it for my tea tonight .

---

Yummy and cheap.  Pay the man, take your food, seat yourself, eat, enjoy.  Total hole-in-the-wall and totally great.

---

Lovely authentic food.

---

cheap and wonderful

---

Best rice and three in town.

---

Best curry in town, no question

---

The member of staff was very friendly and offered amazing service. A little on the procer side but the macha cheesecake was luxurious.

---

Amazing food amazing prices

---

It’s not just about the food which is just plain tasty by the way, it’s about the people behind the counter as well. Though I’ve only been in only a couple of times as I’m travelling from Glasgow the staff are genuinely nice people.

It’s not just about money in this place as they can charge more than what they are charging as it is completely worth it. I’ve a feeling they’re doing this for the community they are in so more people can afford it.

While walking past other shops that are quiet which is a shame in these COVID stricken times ,there is a slow steady stream of customers coming into this establishment.
Maybe not just for the food I’ve witnessed but for the natter and feeling of family you get from mo and Ismail.

I’m pretty well travelled and have ate in a lot of places but the kebab here must be one of the best value ones in the uk. None of that mushed fake Lamb gubbins they serve elsewhere but here it’s proper meat that’s been cooked on a skewer then chargrilled.

Will be back.

---

A staple! I couldn't possibly say enough good things about this restaurant, it is one of my favourite places and arguably the best curry in Manchester! I have eaten here more times than I could count, at some points twice in the same week! Amazing quality and GREAT value for money.

---

Cheap and cheerful.

---

Top food. Can't beat it

---

Loved it, great place and atmosphere

---

Great food and cheap

---

Lovely grub

---

I've been going there for years it's the best place to go nice people good food

---

Affordable and tasty food but limited options (still worth trying because of almost half the cost of food at other places)

---

Restaurant behind the most dodgy looking alleyway 😆 but restaurant interior is decent and simple but not fancy - what you would expect from a quick eat place

A handful of curry options based on the meat or veg. Changes each day, and to be honest, half the time, I have no clue what curry they are, but they're all so nice. Some are slightly spicier than others, so if you can't eat spicy food, then make sure to ask.
Portion sizes are large for the price, and the curries are delicious.

Mango lassi is also available by the glass - just ask for it when you pay at the counter.

---

Consistently outstanding food I have been going here for years no place beats it the best three curries & rice in Manchester and definitely the best keema in Manchester ! Everyone loves This and That

---

Great food and great service, always a pleasure to see Sohail :)

---

Great for a quick cheap curry, no frills but consistently good food. A Manchester institution.

---

A Manchester institution with lovely staff and delicious food at prices unheard of elsewhere in the city. Anthony Bourdain would have loved it.

---

Just the best value food anywhere. Lamb and spinach curry, Dhal Bombay potatoes and rice. Plus samosas and onion bhaji with side salad yoghurt and tamarind? sauce. It looks so unlikely from the outside but it's a genuine gem.

---

This is the place I most love to eat when visiting Manchester.  No frills. Just delicious food at a great price. I shouldn't be telling you this. I don't want it getting too popular.

---

Super leckeres und authentisches indisches Essen! Von außen sieht die Gasse nicht so einladend aus, aber im Laden ist es sauber und man hat sehr schnell sein Essen zu wirklich super Preisen. Jeden Tag der Woche gibt es eine andere Auswahl an Gerichten, die die wir hatten waren sehr lecker und wir sind satt geworden.

---

Hidden gem!

---

Delicious, authentic Indian food. Can get a taste of everything with the rotating menu. Probably the best Indian food I’ve ever had.

---

One of the most incredible places I’ve ever eaten at

---

Lovely people, amazing food. Highly recommend

---

Famous for it's Rice & three, and the place does it nicely. Decent quantity for a single person for the price.

---

First time been for a here curry was great just eat and go brilliant

---

The hippest curry place in Manchester

---

Don't go if you are after a south asian restaurant experience. On the other hand, if you want quality, authentic food at a great price and couldn't care a less for silly chutney trays and Bollywood ambience, this place is a genuine hidden gem. Had the "rice and 3" many times, never disappointed.

---

Tasty food, nice people!

---

Amazing food, and brilliant staff. I have been going here for years and the service has always been fantastic.

---

Fresh and good  quality food 👌

---

Working-class canteen vibes serving delightfully flavourful and heartwarming curry's. Portions are big enough to get you through the week. Always go for 3 curries for the variety. Never say no to the crispy bhajis on offer.

---

Well if you are visitor or a local of manchester and you dont know this place. Then I must say you haven't researched the places to eat in Manchester. If you read the reviews on trip advisor you will know what I mean. Place has been refurbished in the last year. They serve set items on set days. Their Dhal curry served on Mondays, Wednesdays, Fridays and Saturdays is my personal favorite. My friends who visit me from reading and Leeds love it as well.

---

The oldest and one of the best Pakistani restaurants in city centre Manchester.

---

The food is so good! And the vibe is immaculate. Felt like home and the staff was so polite

---

Great low key food stop.

---

Great food, great service, great price, great friendly staff!

---

This and That, an unassuming little place down a side street, full of curry delights.  A dish of rice and a choice of meats and vegetarian options.  Cheap, yes; tasty, absolutely.  Get the timing wrong and you find yourself queuing.

---

Had dinner here in Manchester and went with the daily menu. The food itself was alright, nothing special, but considering the price it was actually good value. I paid just £7 for a dinner, which is hard to beat.

---

Merci beaucoup ! Les quantités sont là, et le personnel est adorable ! Merci pour le yaourt à la mangue gratuit 🫶

---

We went to This and That for the first time today. Very authentic, very delicious and incredibly good value for money. Samosas were absolutely divine!   Staff are lovely. We will definitely definitely return.

---

Ordered a hamper, excellent value for money for such tasty food. The guys that served us were very friendly & welcoming. This will NOT be our last visit.

---

Best rice 'n three in Manchester.

---

Great food, warm hospitality, decent place and service. Highly recommend!!

---

Surely the best hidden gem in Manchester. You can get a great hot plate of food instantly and it’s such good value.

---

Good curry at great prices!

---

Genuinely amazing place. A little gem. Proper solid food and a great atmosphere. Just get stuck in. A seriously solid place.

---

Best hidden gem/ hole in the wall in the UK. Phenomenal Indian food, friendly and warm service, and even open on Christmas Eve!
Truly had to beat. We got 6 curries, garlic naan, chapati, onion bajhi, and samosa! Hard to beat- and only for £25!

---

Incredible bargain. I had a large Lamb Nehari with two naans for £10! The service is incredibly fast and very popular.

---

Me and my family have been eating here on and of since 1992, before I was even born, we love it, the food is always delicious, filling and we get superb service, cant recommend it enough

---

One of Best gems in Manchester

---

Had a great meal here this evening. Staff really friendly, place has great flavor and great vibes! Very good value for money! Will definitely be back. Thanks again

---

There is no better cheap eat in MCR. Every curry on selection is insanely delicious with the bread and samosas being cheap additions to fill you up.

We went for a takeout this weekend and for 2 x decent sized curries with 2 large breads it was just £17. And you KNOW it's gonna hit the spot unlike some takeaways.

It's chaotic inside sometimes, some staff are a little blunt but it's not in a bad way. It adds to the good vibe in some unexplainable way.

---

One of the last bastions of quality curry at affordable prices in the city centre. The fella that runs it is a legend too. May it never change.

---

Amazing food.  Not only for the price but hands down.  Especially in the very heart of the city centre.
Always a diverse mix of people eating here proves how popular it is with everyone.
Highly recommended.

---

Hidden gem!

---

Spot on

---

Good prices and nice food. Disappointed with the onion bahjis and naan bread.

---

This place is quality. Great food and atmosphere. Was in Manchester for the weekend and went twice!

---

Amazing curries!

---

A friend bought a lamb karai and a few extras from here , and gave me some to try. Omg.....just about the best curry I've ever eaten !!. Really succulent lamb , nicely spiced , and a hot naan. This is now my  'go to'  curry house when I'm in the Northern Quarter....which is weekly !. You can sit inside - which is quite basic , with bench seating , or get a take-out ( no deliveries unfortunately). Highly recommended by myself and everyone i know who has tried their food.

---

Heard about This and That for years but never tried, did last night. Will definitely be going back.
3 of us went, three lots of curries and rice each, bhaji each, samosa each, naan bread each. £37 absolute bargain!!!

---

Great little place for good food when out and about in Manchester.  A well-known hidden gem

---

Best indian food in Manchester!

---

Best ultimate 3 curry and rice worldwide with an epic following, seriously the biggest hidden gem in Manchester.

---

Brilliant experience hidden gem. Food was amazing and tasty and some of the best Indian I have had. Even better than a few expensive Indian resturants I have visited too.
Great for the price.
Set expectations if you visit. It is like visiting your grandparents and having dinner and sitting down amongst family. Very welcoming quick to help.
Will be going again.

---

Great quality food at a cheap price.

---

Came here with my brother after walking round Manchester for a few hours - what a great place to stop at. The food tasted great. We had curries, rice and naans and left with empty plates - delicious and hot but not too hot.  The place is easy to miss, tucked down a side street but well worth a bit of searching. We liked that within 3 minutes of walking in we were eating.  Definitely a place to come back to 👍

---

太好吃了，我觉得就算是闭着眼睛选，每道菜都很好吃。餐馆很有烟火气，而且价格非常公道，以后如果有机会来曼城，我必定再次光顾！

---

awesome!

---

Great value

---

If you want a fast curry for £8 without any frills, this is the biz.  You get a plate of rice then choose 3 currys from an array of loveliness.  I usually get the chicken tikka, lamb spinach and one other random spoon full (it was Lamb and Carrots this time, hahaha mental).

But yes if you are short for time, you can be in and out in 10 minutes.  I love it.

---

Great food at a great price!

---

Best kept secret in Manchester

---

You always leave with a huge smile on your face.

Great food, at a great price.

---

A real hidden little gem, the food is great.

---

Always amazing. Cabbage Tuesday rules. Took a colleague from Pune this week and he gave it the thumbs up. I am veggie and there are not many places as good for a veggie lunch in Manchester. Especially not as good in terms of value for money

---

what a hidden gem.

---

Their food always hits the spot, such tasty curries. We normally visit the place whenever we're in Manchester.

---

A hidden gem! The food is fresh and delicious and excellent value.

---

Can’t go wrong with 3 curries, rice, naan, samosa & a drink for £12.50.

---

Lovely quiet little restaurant with friendly staff and delicious food

---

I stopped here earlier to fill my belly on the way to the airport.

The food was absolutely fantastic, better than my local takeaway which I rate highly.

---

Best food i have eaten! Just the right level of spicy! I always take a group of 4-7 friends for the weekend for special dinner!

---

Very nice, I will be back soon

---

Wow!!!! Top curry. Cheap and rapid service. Curries are some of the best in Manchester. If ur in the centre looking for a quick top tier scran then look no further.

---

Amazing food, quirky place, love it

---

A  little hidden gem in Manchester's Northern Quarter. Good quality food for a bargain price. Staff are lovely too. I will definitely be going back!

---

Everything was amazing. We tried both, vegetarian and meat options and everything was very tasty. I definitely recommend it. Tasty food, big portions and good prices.

---

A Manchester classic.

---

The lamb steak is so tender and juicy, really enjoyed the food and an affordable spot in town. The chef is so friendly makes the atmosphere even better thank you!

---

A must go when you're in Manchester. Generous plates of curries and rice for less than a tenner. Order a naan too and it still won't make it over a tenner.

The curries aren't life changing, but they have a real sense of comfort - as if your grandma cooked them for you. They provide freshly chopped chillies, onions, and coriander to help brighten your food up.

Daily changing menu, so come with a spontaneous spirit. Service was great too, very friendly and speedy. The dining room feels like you're eating on someone's living room - very cozy.

If you want affordable and tasty food, come here!

---

Delicious food, friendly staff.

---

This place is NOT a restaurant, however, the food, the staff and, amazingly, the ambience was great.  Cheap and cheerful but a lucky find.

---

A deceptive facade hides a gem of a restaurant.

A very well priced menu with a healthy variety of options and kind staff.

The seating is comfortable but the paint could use a refresh.

Highly recommend over other local spots serving similar options due to better Price and quality

---

Probably the best value curry house Manchester.

---

Really enjoy this spot, simple - just walk in pick out what you want and there you go a hot plate with good food!

---

Super cheap, clean and really tasty! And that in the middle of the city!

---

Everything is amazing and delicious!! The most friendly staff as well. Will definitely come here again!

---

Great food

---

Been coming here regularly since 1984 when it first opened. Albeit. Rice n 3 was £1.50 then and a kebab sandwich was 80p. Always been excellent food, excellent value, great staff. Wouldnt of been comng here 40 years if it wasnt. Best value about. Meal,drink n chapati for a 10er in the city centre

---

Hidden gem. Best value for money. Sunday nehari is the best

---

Tasty and very authentic food. They were happy to give when asked for some extra Curry. Will recommend at least once. I couldn't find such a tasty Lamb Nehair anywhere else

---

It is always worth a visit if you want to enjoy delicious authentic Indian food!
Thank you Moe and Team!

---

Hidden gem love this place the food is fantastic and the staff are really friendly

---

Delicious food and good value.

---

Best rice and three in the city!

---

Visited first time today, I had the 3 Curries, rice and a nan bread, big portion and the best curry I have tasted. Nice and clean place and helpful staff. Will definitely be back.

---

Visiting Manchester for the evening on my own, I asked someone where I could find a decent curry. I was directed to Mo, the owner of this and that and I was not disappointed. Mo was incredibly welcoming, friendly and his food is delicious, by his own admission, it's a no frills place but there is a reason it has been here for 40 years! The restaurant support the local homeless community on a Thursday evening too.
Absolutely worth a visit, you won't be disappointed.

---

Lovely people, lovely food, amazingly cheap

---

Best Currys in Manchester

---

Excellent Indian food

---

Love this place, great food, fast friendly service. Great prices xx

---

Fantastically delicious and authentic cheap eats. Excellent veggie choices too. :-)

---

Best place in Town (Manchester City Centre ) for rice and three (3 currys) lots to choose from and it still feels like it did bck in the day

---

Price to quality ratio can't be beat

---

Completely unpretentious tasty Indian food that is an absolute bargain.

---

Tasty, cheap and authentic 👌

---

One of the best desi food places in the land! The guy who runs it is a very generous and down to earth person.

---

Amazing food can't recommend it enough.

---

I have just had my first curry from This and That, It tasted so much I am very impressed, can't wait to go again.

---

Exceptional quality food. Cheap and filling.

---

Tasty fresh homestyle food at reasonable prices. It can't be faulted and luckily I don't live in Manchester as I'd be there twice a day and 20 stone heavier!

---

Great value rice & 3.

---

Best rice and three place in town

---

An institution, dont live your life without ever visiting

---

Best Rice and Three Curry place in Manchester

---

Cheap, tasty and can be in and out in 10 minutes. Nothing to not like.

---

Great food. Real unappreciated gem.

---

Went there last night with some friends, the food was lovely! Service was also fantastic and a really nice atmosphere. For £10 you can get a really nice curry and a drink, what more could you ask for?

---

Unreal. Don't even think about it just go. £6 a plate in 2024. Don't know where they are making savings because it isn't on flavour.

---

Seriously just try this place for yourself an I promise you, there will be no disappointment that day. It will be filled with Joy & Delight!

---

Amazing

---

Don't ask questions - just go

Cheap and very cheerful

---

Without doubt the best curry I have ever had! Do yourself a favour and indulge, delicious!

---

Great curries, great service! 100% will be coming back to this place. Easy to miss. But what a find it was! You NEED to try this place if you want a no frills excellent meal.

---

Honestly, why go anywhere else?

Quick, delicious and unbelievable value food. This place is genuinely brilliant. Cannot praise enough

---

Had a lovely meal very friendly staff highly recommended that is if you could find the place hidden gem

---

Is by far the best place for a curry in Manchester. This and That is probably my most visited restaurant and with good reason. The food is always excellent, the people are so friendly and price is great.

If you haven't been before, don't let the canteen style put you off, it only adds to the charm.

---

Always been a fan since 2017. I get straight here when I'm home sick thats how good the food and vibe is 🔥

---

Very tasty, big portion, great price 😁

---

Always amazing. Great value, great quality. Onion bhaji are the best.

---

Can't really beat it can you

---

Amazing food, service and prices. Definitely a must every time I’m in Manchester!

---

Phenomenal food and even better people, treated us like we had known them for years, let us in as they were shutting and kept it open for us to finish. Couldn't ask for a better place for good and azingly cheap food.

---

Fantastic place to eat some delicious Indian food. Came here on a recommendation and I'm so glad we did. I had the Keema (which was amazing), Chicken Tikka and the potatoe and cauliflower and an onion bhaji on the side. All very tasty and it really is worth a visit you are nearby. Lastly the staff/owners were very friendly and were super welcoming even though they were rushed off their feet!

---

Nice authentic little spot, great value for money

---

Great food. Great service.

---

Absolute love! I have known this place for a few years now and it’s never disappointed. The spice is right, a great selection of different curries served canteen style. Great atmosphere, real people, gorgeous food and a small price. Stop reading and go there :)

---

I really liked their curry. This is the best place if you are hungry. The portions are enough or even more than enough. If you like Indian curry, you should go there.

---

My go to place for curry in Manchester. It's tasty, it's quick, it's all you can ask for. Great variety and menu that changes daily. The staff is always pleasant to deal with, and the quality never disappoints. A truly hidden gem.

---

This restaurant was all we wanted - affordable, home made, indian food with fast and friendly service. Not the most amazing indian food but it is amazing for the price. A tad on the spicy side for our children but overall a great experience! And they threw in a free cookie and brownie as well! Great evening out.

---

Tasty, cheap and filling. Great food. Cheap. Could do with a bit more imagination with the veggie curry menu. Gets a bit crowded sometimes because it's so good.

---

Definition of a hidden gem, tucked away in a backstreet, gorgeous authentic curries for a very reasonable price in a canteen style place, perfect place to stop on your lunch break

---

Delicious food, big portions, quick and friendly staff

---

Love this place. Great family run business.
Friendly.
Great food.
Does the job!

---

Great currys and superbly made kebabs.

---

This hidden gem is the best known of several similar outlets in Manchester's northern quarter. Don't let the plastic chairs and Formica tables put you off, the food is amazing. Nothing like your usual Indian restaurant, these curries are proper, no-nonsense, delicious and spicy. Feels like authentic food. Always a choice with good veggie selection. Makes my mouth water just thinking about it!

---

The place looks a little bit old from outside but the food is delicious, i strongly recommend it. However, you cannot pay via credit card, only cash.

---

Excellent food and excellent quality 👌

---

As ever, amazing food
Best value in town

---

Rice and 3 Curry's, hearty traditional meals, very tasty and affordable

---

First time coming here to eat, proper desi style food, original flava throughout 😋  fairly prices and fast service, this is my new local Sunday brunch 😀
I would recommend the nihari, but all the curry dishes are nice, thank you

---

Fantastic little spot off the beaten track for amazingly delicious and extremely well-priced food. When we followed the directions to find this place we thought we may have been lost since the entrance is in a little alleyway behind another restaurant. But we smelled the amazing food so we walked a little further and found the entrance. The menu is on the wall with all of the amazing choices that are offered on each day of the week. We ended up sharing because we only had 10 pounds and it's cash only. The staff were very friendly, the food was delicious, and the prices were more than fair. We will definitely be returning!

---

I love this place , lots of varieties, staff & price

---

Must visit Manchester icon.

---

Excellent food and excellent service I would definitely recommend this restaurant

---

After 30 years this place is still simply the best, better than all the rest

---

It is value for money.

That's what itbis, you get a bit better than what you pay for.

Service is quick, food is delicious and pricing is unbelievable.

---

£6.50 for a rice and three curries. Can't be beaten. Food is always 👌.

---

Simple, good quality food. Served fresh in a communal environment. One of Manchester's hidden little gems

---

Just marvellous

---

Fast service, great food, great price. Just a great place all round.

---

I love you, always & forever

---

Amazing food. Would recommend getting at least one veg. With 2 meat. Typical order is rice 2 meat and 1 veg. Only 5 pound for 2 veg and 1 meat!!!

---

Awesome little place.

---

It's This & That on Soap Street, it's in the Lonely Planet as somewhere to eat in Manchester. I've been going to T&T for 20+ years & when I'm in town will go for my rice with three.

---

Been going in for nearly 40 years it's great and I love it.

---

Brilliant as ever.  What a place. An institution that needs to be protected

---

Simply delicious food, fast service and friendly atmosphere

---

The food was very tasty, reasonably priced, and in good quantity.
The restaurant was very popular with a quick turnover of customers.

I enjoyed it, but my wife couldn't finish it because it was too spicy, and my 3-year-old son ate only rice because it was too spicy.
It was a huge portion, but we ate it all up silently and without complaint.
Be careful with children.

---

Ce petit restaurant indien vous propose une cuisine de qualité et à des prix très abordables. Ne sert pas d’alcool. Grandes tables, on dresse sa table. C’est atypique, cela fait son charme. A découvrir

---

Absolutely loved it ❤
Food was really nice
Staff are great.will defo return soon.👍

---

This is my favourite Indian place! Every time I go anywhere else I’m diss appointed because nowhere is as good as This n That. The food is healthy. The prices are very good. The food is delicious. 100/10

---

Wonderful!

---

Great curry for a fantastic price

---

My favourite rice and 3 curry places in the NQ. Amazing value, authentic and the guys who run the place are brilliant.

---

This is a tiny backstreet cafe tucked away near shudehill in Manchester. It serves lovely curry and rice.  Three meat curries plus rice for £8.00. The menu changes daily but there is always Chicken curry. Don't expect fine dining this is a cafe with wooden bench tables with chairs or stools. Everyone together. Brilliant

---

Mega Essen zu fairen Preisen.
Wir lieben dieses Restaurant und gehen immer hin, wenn wir in Manchester sind.

---

Tasty food. Excellent value. Vegetarian / vegan options. Great ambience and you get your food in a flash. No nonsense. Highly recommended.

---

Amazing Indian for such a good price, recommend this place to everyone!

---

Hidden jem!

---

Can’t beat a plate of good homemade curry.
7 day rotating menu

---

Incredible value for money

---

Authentic great value tasty food, Corey recommend it more!!

---

The great value food! Always love to eat here..

---

Wonderful spot

---

Upon entry, it immediately becomes obvious that this iconic Indian eatery has a mystical quality. I was greeted by genuinely one of the most friendly fellows in the casual-Indian-food industry, who was more than happy to cure my decision paralysis by ordering me what he (correctly) thought I would like, and also tossed in a free garlic naan bread. This place is apparently famous for the competitively-priced and generously-portioned three curries-one rice deal, in which I most enjoyably partook. The setting is low-key and happy-coloured (which I would take any day over the dull, chic palate that most modern places seem to be adopting), and the long tables mean that you may have to seat yourself beside a stranger and overhear an intense discussion about their relationship issues with Kieran, who sounds like he probably just needs some space right now, but it's not your place to say - just eat your three curries, carefully apportioning your supply of basmati rice, and run. The place was dotted with little groups of such voraciously chatting locals, and you may feel as if you wandered into a university cafeteria. Bonus points for the mural with the Bolton Wanderers emblem enlarged beside the other lesser-historied Manchester teams.

---

Amazing flavors immediately served at very fair prices. The seating leaves a lot to be desired but takeout is an option.

---

Freshly made homey Indian food

---

Amazing food, lovely staff, quick simple service, great way to try new curries, if you don’t like spicy say as some of them have some heat 😂🥹

---

Best curry in Manchester by far, food is amazing. Staff are so friendly and nice, gave us free food to try because it was our first time there. And it’s so cheap! Especially for inner city. New favourite place!

---

Cheap delicious indian food. Best samosas ever!!

---

Called in today - it really is hidden away! Worth seeking it out - had a gorgeous meal each, garlic naan and onion bhaji and a drink, for less than the cost of a Maccies. Can't wait to visit again. Thankyou.

---

Great value for the price. Can choose three kinds curry from £6.00.

---

friendly service, affordable menu and most importantly, tasty food - best curries i've had in the city!! and don't forget to try their £1 mango lassi :) will be coming back for sure

---

Great Indian restaurant for a quick, cheap lunch

---

Usually I hit up the lamb dishes these days.  Be sure to sprinkle plenty of chopped onions. It's cheap and cheerful but very delicious and feels nourishing.

---

Ambiance familiale et chaleureuse. Vendeur drôle et sympathique.
Je vous recommande d’y aller et de vous installer en commandant les plats du jour qui sont délicieux. Un régal assuré !

---

Best curries in town

---

Brilliant and great value, best place to stop for a quick bite in Manchester.

---

Good rice and three, friendly staff, good atmosphere. Very good value for money.
Thanks

---

Best curry place in town!!

---

Unbelievable value and the curry is so good. The staff were so friendly and generous. If you’re in Manchester, this place is a must go.

---

My first visit will definitely not be the last. Great asian diner. Fantastic tasty currys. Great value. 3 currys, rice and nan for £7. Food was full of flavour. Will be returning.

---

Great food and very reasonable prices

---

Had a lovely mean here, great homemade curries and reasonably priced too and staff amazing too! 🙌🙌

---

This has been on my radar for some time, so when unexpectedly in Manchester and my wife wanted to get a cheap meal, I suggested we try here.

My wife wasn't overly impressed, as she didn't like the café style surroundings, down a dodgy looking ally.

As for me, I thought £8 for the rice and three meat curries was excellent value and for the price, the quality of the food and the taste was excellent. Will definitely return, but will bring my friends instead.

---

A hidden gem with lots of atmosphere. Tried This & That for the first time off recommendation and it certainly didn't disappoint. There's a charismatic feel to this place which feels quintessentially Mancunian. Highly recommend.

---

Never disappoints. Rice and three veggie curries for £4.50 served with a smile. What more can I say! Fast food at its finest

---

Fast service, Good e hot food, Kind Staff!. I love the place. Im vegan and fellt so well there. The rice  with 3 vegans options was amazing.

---

An institution ❤️

---

Amazing food and amazing hospitality - thank you we will definitely be back soon

---

Really nice spot for a curry,  very tasty no complaints from me.

Reasonable price, staff very kind let me try a dish I would never have chosen which turned out to be very tasty.
The staff then later came around while we were eating and offered us a free fizzy drink.

Overall very happy with my food choice

---

Great food as always

---

Always a great curry here.

---

Simply the Best

---

The food is good , is more for those who like spicy food

---

Usual quality outstanding

---

Excellent food and fast friendly service every single time! I could happily eat there every day.

---

Good indain food

---

Still the same this and that's. Hardly changed in 40 years I've been going. You still get a plate full of rice and 3 assorted curries ( that you choose from a large selection) for around £7. Selection is on a big board as you enter. This is no frills food but brilliant quality

---

Top food and well priced

---

Always extra tasty

---

Great place to eat! Hidden gem. At first I thought it was going to be disgusting as I in fact judged a book by its cover. However, to my bewilderment it was out of this world!

---

I was so happy to see that this place is still open. It is without doubt the best Indian cuisine in Manchester.

---

Fantastic tasty food.Just what l needed on a cold day. Curries are amazing.The staff are very nice.

---

Been going to this and that off and on for 42 years. Never had a problem with
the staff or the food, I've took several people over the years and they are all still going in when they are on Manchester. Keep it up fella's.

---

It's the best. Don't tell anyone please  :)

---

What can I say  ive been going to This N that  since I was 19 working in Tandys in Manchester Arndale, even when I left there I carried on going , the food wa s and still is out of this world  for the pricee in the city centre ,  always fresh and tasty and different menus daily, I love the kebab sandwiches they make freshly cooked as you go in m nice and spicy but not too hot  with a fresh salad served on a fresh made Nann and then theres the sauce they put on its like a mint and chilli  without the yoghurt, s lovely cool at first and then a nice kick, I now live in Lincoln and up until a few months ago I used to travel over to Manchester to This N that  and get a few kebabs  and curries to bring back with me  I fully recommended a visit here, ,All can  say  after thirty years   its got to be good , a massive well done to all the staff past n present

---

Excellent food at a great price. Nice atmosphere.

---

Fantastic food. Basic and straightforward in a great way, like home cooked Indian food.
Lovely staff. Highly recommend.

---

I truly love this place.

---

Exceptional food and service

---

an absolutely delicious hidden gem of Manchester. affordable and authentic food with really big portions!

---

Nah this place is unreal! I can’t believe something could be so literal of the meaning of a hidden gem. Tucked away, this delicious restaurant/takeaway offers some of the best tasting, generous, affordable food in the whole of Manchester. I have tried multiple 2-3 curries on rice and this by far is the best one in Manchester.

---

Full curries for under £7 and they’re absolutely delicious. Took 3 of us in here the other day and fed us all, with sides and a drink each for under £30. It’s a little bit basic, set out a bit like a school or work canteen, and the staff aren’t always overly friendly but what can you really say when you’re eating that well for that cheap.

---

Saag gosht and keema gosht were stunning. Love the extra chillies at the counter as well. Great texture, spice level and depth of flavour.

The murgh tikka basically just came in tomato sauce. Wasn't good but still give 5 stars overall.

---

Still one of my favourites after over 10 years. This and That is an institution!

---

Sehr lecker und gute Preise. Hier darf man sich nicht von dem äußeren Erscheinungsbild täuschen lassen. Die Einrichtung ist rustikal und einfach - aber hier geht’s ja um das Essen. Und das ist sehr zu empfehlen. Preisleistung - ist sehr gut.

---

One of my favourite places to eat in the whole world.
£6.50 for some of the nicest food I've ever eaten. No trip to Manchester is complete without a visit to This & That.

---

Amazing...experience!
Delicious food at unbeatable prices.
Staff friendly and very helpful.

---

Just an AWESOME experience, and Mo who was serving us was also amazing! Thank you, I’ll defo come again and recommend it!
For the French, Allez-y c’est fantastique! De la vraie cuisine indienne à ce prix, dingue!

---

Great food but can be very busy at lunchtime.

---

Delicious food cheap prices in a back street hard to locate but a gem of a place definately worth the search

---

One of best curry I have ever had.
Like how you get to try 3 and very good naan 👏🏼 🫓

---

Amazing food and instant service. A real gem

---

The food will never disappoint you. The food has been amazing for decades.

---

This and that is an excellent canteen-style curry house. For £7.00, the 2 meat curries and 1 veg curry are amazing, quick service, with a new selection of curries everyday. I have honestly lost track of the amount of times me and my friends have visited this and that, never had a bad experience.

I'd recommend the mixed vegetable curry, along with the lamb and carrots and chicken curry.

---

Super secret nice thing

---

Beautiful

---

Lovely food. Big portions (to share) Tasty and well priced. Would definitely recommend :)

---

Excellent food - perfect spicing, good quality - for amazing prices. Everything is good so it's hard to recommend a particular dish - try it all!

---

Great food, affordable prices. Definitely I will come back again.

---

Good selection of curries, cheap and cheerful. Something different, to try once at least if you haven't already.

---

Good place for casual South Asian food. The place gets busy from 12 pm onwards and become hard to find a seat. Overall very good place for people from Bangladesh, India and Pakistan.

---

One of the kindest staff I have ever met! Price and portion lovely :)

---

Best place for currys in Manchester

---

Wow!!!! Soo good!!!! 😊❤️

---

Flavour central - every curry is just packed with loads of flavour in every bite! Love the keema, love a little sprinkle of diced onion on top of my plate, love everything about this place. Staff were super friendly too.

---

Comida India riquísima en un ambiente informal. Te ponen un plato con arroz y 3 curries a elegir. Cada plato 6 libras
Da un poco de susto callejear hasta allí pero merece la.pena. Todo pica bastante

---

Great Food, for a fair prince. would recommend

---

I have been going two this and that cafe cos it is the best curry house in Manchester love it

---

great service, food, and price ☺️☺️👍🏼

---

You want curry? They've got curry.
Rice n three is a Manchester institution for a reason. This n that is cheap, filling and delicious. Always a friendly welcome and an unusual curry.

---

Taste very good and affordable price.

Rice & 3 Veg: £6.00
Rice & 1 Meat & 2 Veg: £6.50
Rice & 2 Meat & 1 Veg: £7.00
Rice & 3 Meat: £8.00

---

Excellent quality food for a great price and very welcoming.
Will be coming back.

---

It's a great taste with a great value

---

Amazing, great food, great price,super friendly staff and a great atmosphere..

---

Amazing Indian food at incredible prices. Come here for the no fuss and no frills food and service that is perfect for a friendly and authentic meal.
Whatever they’ve made that day, I’m sure it’ll be great!
Lamb dishes and chicken tikka were wonderful when we were there and garlic naan is a must.
Toilets are nice too.

---

This place is SO good. Unpretentious, friendly and efficient staff and most of all.... damn tasty food!! It gets busy so you can feel crammed in but in my opinion, that's part of its charm

---

Amazing food, amazing people, I’ve come here over the years now and it’s still is one of the best spots for some authentic Indian food. If you are ever in Manchester check this place out, you won’t regret it and the prices are so reasonable also.

---

This is the must try resturant in Manchester. Great food and great portion which you won't expected in other resturants in town, esp in such a downtown area. I had lamb and chicken which were really tender and nice. The lamb meat is juicy and tender and tasty, not too spicy. What impressed is the owner who worked in the shop for 35 years and still working during Covid. Even he mentioned the customers were only half of the crowd, he still keeps the same quality of the food. He worth our applause and respect.

---

Très bonne expérience. Très bon et pas cher !

---

Extremely friendly staff, the curry is delicious, you cant find a price like this anywhere else. The naan was exceptional :) will be coming back… probably multiple times a week

---

A fantastic hole in the wall spot for great Indian food at a great price. They have a nice assortment of food that rotates daily. We found the serving sizes to be perfect for a filling meal. The lamb spinach and chick peas in particular were great.

---

Great food, nice people, and super affordable!

---

Amazing curry and amazing prices!

---

Best curry in Manchester!

---

Nice little eatery in the middle of Manchester! Great authentic Indian food. Superb value!

---

Delicious curries. Great for a quick meal, lunch deal is £3.90 for 3 vegetarian/vegan curries with rice (costs more for meat). Will definitely be coming back

---

Best curry by far ☺our son's been eating here since 9 months old.Love the place.

---

Great place to have a curry when out and about in town atomoshere and food is excellent.

---

I had a fantastic experience here enjoying their flavorful nasi briyani! The rice was perfectly cooked and fragrant, with a generous portion that’s both filling and satisfying. It came with three delicious side dishes, each full of authentic spices and rich flavors that complemented the briyani beautifully. The best part is the affordability—great quality and taste without breaking the bank! Highly recommended for anyone craving a tasty and budget-friendly Indian meal.

---

Unreal. 2 meat 1 veg with rice on a Wednesday: lamb and pea, chicken curry, spinach and potato. All the garnish. Samosas fire too. Lovely little place for quick tea, nice seeing all sorts of people eating there. Staff very friendly. One day I will try every single dish

---

Great service by Shoyab. Very friendly and always happy to help.

The food is absolutely amazing here. Especially the nihari on Sundays. It's the best you'll get in Manchester. Highly recommend it to anyone in the city centre on a Sunday to try it.

---

Discovered that little spot as I was walking to Northern Quarter... The food is of good quality and you get a full plate for a really cheap price.

---

Small shop nestled in an alley hiding a warm place with simplicity. Here we are welcomed by a team that will not fail to make you jokes and we serve you a Rice & Three curry. Cheap and delicious in addition!

---

Rice 'n' 3. Daal, potatoes and cauliflower, chicken £6.50. 👌
Great place T'n'T. Manchester's finest 😊

---

Frantic

---

Great curries at a great price.

---

Absolutely delicious.

---

Great as always. The Sunday Special 'Nihari' (curry) was lovely.

---

Hidden gem. Just eat what the give you.

---

Everything you want when it comes to great curry. No frills, no nonsense, just great food.

---

This & that is a real hidden gem, family run, delicious food (every time) and really cheap!

---

Authentic simple cuisine great value and wonderful little social spot ..  if you can find it you are in for a treat... our 3rd time eating here having the daily offer of 3 curries and rice for £8 with optional chapati ... you will love it

---

fantastic food, great people

---

Excellent place for you to be able to get a meal..... fantastic food

---

Great place.

---

Excellent value for money.

---

Top curry cheap price

---

Best rice and three in Manchester, the staff some how recognised my dad even though he hadnt been in for 15 years due to moving away to live in Ireland.

---

Wonderful remembering india

---

Awesome food

---

Faster than a macdonalds, healthier than a macdonalds, cheaper than a macdonalds, tastier than a macdonalds. Got served a plate full of awesome in 30 seconds.

---

Fantastic as always, dropped in Saturday evening with our daughters, we wanted to introduce one of their boyfriends to the delight that is our favourite place to eat in Manchester. See you all again soon.

---

Cheap, delicious curry, and decent portions.

---

Amazing food, lovely friendly people.

---

Belle trouvaille ! C est une cantine avec d excellents plats bien frais. Tout était bon de l agneau au lassi en passant par les samoussas. La serveuse a fait goûter à mon fils les plats pour qu il se décide et le patron ne nous a pas fait payer de surplus quand il en a repris parce qu il avait adoré ! Ne vous attendez pas à un endroit cosy mais l'ambiance est sympa avec beaucoup de travailleurs locaux qui viennent manger rapidement.

---

Simply Awsome! 👌🏻

---

The best curry in Manchester good service quick and cheap you better go

---

E,xcellent food at low prices

---

Wow, we just had the best meal!  Everything was so flavorful and cooked perfectly.  The service was great too, our server was so friendly and helpful.  We'll definitely be back soon to try more of the menu.  Highly recommend this place!

---

What a great place! Located down an unlikely-looking back alley this restaurant serves delicious Indian food quickly and at a fantastic price.  The restaurant itself is not much to look at but that's not the point. Five pounds for a plate full of delicious vegetarian curries and rice is what it's all about. (Meat curries are available too). The menu changes each day and has a limited range of choices. Bulk cooking keeps the price down. The food is served up instantly on plastic plates. The people were very nice too.  It's a great place and I hope to be able to go there again soon.

---

Amazing food, served by lovely people. So glad we found it tucked away. Do it.

---

Lovely people, we left full and happy.

---

We had a great experience. Kids very welcome. They even got rice and Naan Bread because the lovely Curries where a bit hot for them.
I just have to write something to the bad review by Philippe Nieto. He ment that he gave the owner £30 (1 20£ note and 1 10£note) but the owner said that he gad given him only 2 10£. The owner said then they could find out a bit later by cheching the CCTV. Philippe startet shouting that he will give a bad review and throw his food on the floor and left the place making everybody realy uncomforble.

---

Best rice and three  curry in Manchester.  Great options, fast ssrvice.  Easy to walk to, choose selection if curry and eat within a work dinner hour.  Bargain as well

---

Malgré une ruelle peu avenante qui fait penser à Batman, n'hésitez pas à pousser la porte de ce petit resto au look de cantine. Des plats et des saveurs qui vous feront voyager, un accueil et un personnel très sympa et avenant . Je recommande .

---

Really tasty Tika Masala and rice with 2 sodas for £11. Outstanding.

---

Top draw

---

Great little Curry House, loved the food and friendly staff 👍

---

Best curry cafe in Manchester for decades. And today's lunch reconfirms this is still the case. Brilliant food. 2 Rice and Three's, 2 seekh kebabs, 2 chapatis and a can for a ridiculous £17.

---

Their rice & 3 curries was truly outstanding, the service was friendly and cheerful, and the price was totally reasonable. An absolute gem of a restaurant that I'd happily visit again!

---

Good food at a reasonable price and quick service

---

A taste of real Indian food. Expect no frills but an authentic feel and delicious food. As for the price, this must be the best deal in town, a plate of rice and three curries for as little as £4.50, bargain!!

---

Best curry in manchester...1 n 3....1 rice n 3 separate curries..belting ❤

---

Fantastic hidden gem. One of the best curry places in Manchester

---

Place is down an unattractive side alley. First time here about 6pm. Place was hectic but the staff kept on top of everything and was served pretty fast. Food was amazing and the nan bread came straight from the oven steaming hot. Prices are very cheap considering its in the heart of Manchester.

---

Brilliant 👍👍👍

---

A no frills canteen style curry house run by friendly owners. The rice and three meat curries is so tasty and great value at £6.50.

---

Excellent food and cheap as chips. Will definitely pay a visit next time I'm on town. 3 curries with rice and chapati and each curry was very tasty.

---

Great food, happy service, great value.

---

A great little place to try and recommend the '3 curries & rice'. Very tasty curries. Tends to get busy at lunchtime.

---

Fantastic place. Been going here for ages. It just keeps getting better. Shame I don't work in Manchester anymore otherwise I'd be in here 3 times a week. My only place for lunch when I'm in town.  My favourite day is Tuesday, but you'll find something each day to tantalise your taste buds.  Staff are really friendly and the food is great. Get there soon. You'll enjoy!

---

Great place for a curry. Cheap, friendly, delicious, spotlessly clean,great vibes.

---

Its all about the food

---

Food on point . 2nd time here. Always excellent,rice and 3 curries + garlic naan for less than £10. Cannot fault 5 star

---

Great for families.

---

If I come into Manchester I come here.

---

Love the food love the service

---

One of the best 'rice and three' you will go to.

---

Best Curry Canteen *on the planet*

---

Best curry in manni

---

Really a hidden gem! You wouldn’t notice it if you didn’t have the intention of finding it. Small place (I don’t imagine the outside has changed since the 80s!), basic set-up: you go up and get your rice and 3 main items. £7 for rice, 1 veg and 2 meats. Can put as many white onions, chillis and coriander on your plate as you like at the end. They also sell samosas, pakoras, naans etc. All really fresh and flavourful food - in particular I’d recommend the keema. Staff also had a smile on their face. Solid stuff, I intend to come back!

---

Great food every time, would 100% recommend.

---

No os lo perdáis, comida India buena y barata. Súperamables. Parece que son toda una institución en Mánchester.

---

A hearty meal and great value for money.

---

Always great

---

Been comign to this and that for so many years, love all it every time, great food, great prices, dont be put off by the location. The food is second to none for a great curry lunch

---

This place is just wonderful.

---

Hidden gem in Manchester.  Kind of a canteen style place

---

Some of the best curry in the city. Well worth the detour for

---

Superb canteen curry, no frills but great quality and cheap!

---

Nice, great value, hidden gem.

---

Very good and cheap indian food! Best curry place! Nice people!

---

Fantastic curries at a very reasonable price. Friendly service. 100% recommended.

---

Very popular place, their classic 3 curries on rice is some of the best Indian in town, while being inexpensive. It's also very fast to serve, given the simple concept. Hard to choose a favourite among the options.
Be aware that there are no mild curries, they all have some kick, but they do start from reasonable levels of spiciness.
You can take our or sit in one of the long communal tables.

---

Absolutely banging food. Great price and super fast service. Really glad to have found it. Definitely will be returning here. I'd urge you to do the same!

---

Absolutely love this place. Getting my lunch here regularly because of its vicinity, value for money, friendly staff and delicious curry.

---

Hats off for the food it was brilliant, highly recommend this place!!!

---

You will probably think you turned down the wrong way and then you notice the door and in you go into a Manchester gem. Probably the best curry you will manage to find in the Northern Quarter if not the whole of Manchester. If you are visiting this has to be on your list. If you live here and haven't been, what's up with you? Go!  Food is delicious, service is amazing and you will be shocked at the price. Well worth the money.

---

Iv eaten here for well over 15 years it never disappoints

---

Love this place!
My go to 3 currys are lamb off the bone, chicken tikka masala and the keema! Add plenty of white onion some green chillies and coriander and yoghurt sauce. Perfect 🤍

---

Wife and I decided on This and That for Sunday lunch.

Rice and three meats / Rice, two meats and one Veg / garlic naan / 2 bhajis / two cans - £16.80

Fantastic value, probably the tastiest Indian take away in the City!

The lamb nahari and the lamb w/ spinach were excellent!

Thank you guys

---

Best indian food I’ve eaten. Practical and delicious. God bless. Too bad I don’t live in the city. Came here everyday to eat while i was here.

---

Amazing place. Amazing food. Amazing service. Amazing prices. I’ll be back 👍🏻

---

Best Indian in Manchester 👍

---

Lovely olace

---

Great curry. Shame they dont provide jugs of water on the tables anymore. Have to buy bottled if you want a drink

---

A hidden Manchester secret. Cheap curry with great taste

---

Amazing. Delicious!

---

Was a regular here for many years - good quality home cooked style Indian food at a reasonable price.

---

Great concept - wholesome delicious food at a very reasonable price.

---

My partners favourite,I like it too as I love curry 🍛! Coriander is fab for your health too, heavy metal detoxification 😁

---

Great food & very cheap, I would definitely recommend

---

Amazing Indian restaurant tucked away in the Northern Quarter. The outside is quite unassuming and down an alley which, at night, can be scary and uninviting. However, once you get inside you're greeted with welcoming faces and delicious smelling food. It has a very informal canteen style atmosphere where you order at the front and find yourself a seat on a bench after.

The menu changes every day (look at the website for what's on that day) and the prices are very reasonable considering the portions are generous. I had rice with 2 meat and 1 veg, all of which was absolutely delicious! I was very full by the end of it.

Even on a Tuesday it can be busy at lunch so I'd recommend going early, but people finish quickly so getting a seat isn't difficult.

Will definitely be back to try the menu on other days.

---

Great!

---

Class food

---

Great place for a curry

---

Food is amazing, don't be put off by the location

---

First time in the UK and first dish in UK. Food was awesome and homemade taste. Great recommendation.

---

Absolutely delicious street food style Indian , an absolute diamond of a place , doesn’t look much from outside but tastes amazing and lovely staff , 3 curry and rice a bargain 👌

---

Literally the best-tasting curry in Manchester city center. Soup kitchen vibes get the rice and three. Never disappoints.

---

Honestly just perfect -  no fuss, incredible value good food.

---

Rice, three excellent curries, a paratha, bhaji and a rubicon for 12 quid...

---

Always top class food,  what you see is what you get

---

Abousltley brilliant food went with my daughter and grandaughter will definitely go again

---

Practically a Mancunian institute and you should eat here at least once in your life if you live in the city.  It won't be the best curry you've ever had, or the most grandiose place you've ever eaten but you will get great tasting food at a great price.  Serving since 1984 and there is a reason they've been open for over 30 years

Menu choices vary depending on day of the week, good vegetarian options.

---

Picture doesn’t do it justice. I have been visiting this place for 15 years and has been probably the most consistently good food place I have ever been to.

---

Best curry in Manchester

---

This and That is a convenient, city center diner.

Reasonable prices, there's a variety lunch menu to choose from even though I thoroughly prefer the lamb.

Nice staff, very chill atmosphere, good place to go for a grub.

---

Honestly obsessed with this place, it's quiet with no music blasting like most places in Manchester. The food is always fantastic and the staff are always lovely!

---

Good food at an excellent price - I love treating myself to a Friday lunch here!

---

the KINDEST and SWEETEST staff every. delicious food. please please go this place is our favorite

---

My go-to for quick, delicious and cheap curry. Must do in Manchester. Also the mango lassi is to die for

---

So good! I had rice and three veg - they were all very tasty and can’t go wrong for £6! My partner enjoyed his meat curries. Two rice and three, a garlic naan, one samosa and two cans for £19.30! You’re not getting food this good anywhere else in town for that price! Just wish I’d been sooner. Can’t wait to come back. Really friendly staff! Other people were having chapati’s and mango lassi’s and they looked really good.

---

Outrageously good food for the price. Lovely family atmosphere too. I love it.

---

Very friendly place and the food is superb.

---

Always been my favourite place. Rice and 3 for under £7. Fresh roti. It's just the best place.

---

We had rice with 2 meat and 1 veg. It tastes so good. Worth every penny 🙌🏻🙏🏻 the owner is so friendly from  (half british and thai girl ☺️)

---

Good food! Good service! Would definitely recommend people to try this place.

---

an absolute gem! the food was amazing (tikka masala was my favorite!), had some naan, samosas and the fried onions with it. i highly recommend getting the 3 curry plate! lassi was great too!

the owner is very friendly and clearly shows his passion for his family owned business, we will be back!! :)

---

Greatest rice and 3 in Manchester! Choose rice and a choice of 3 seperate curries for around £5. You can't go wrong

---

Best food I had outside India!

---

Absolutely lush curry

---

Just been down to manchester for family visit big shout out to the staff for fab food to take home to Scotland thank yu.

---

It was brilliant thank you.
Catherine

---

A really authentic treat. Excellent value, super food cooked to perfection in a no frills, central, 'hidden' location.

---

Three different types of tender lamb curry on a bed of rice, all for £8.00, heaven! Basic interior but that doesn't matter when the food tastes so good

---

It was so so so so so amazing. Delicious unpretentious food and very warm people.

---

The owner of the local was very pleasant, helped us to decide what to choose and treated us with a smile. He even asked later on if we were full and if everything was good.
I really recommend this place because the food is delicious and it's quite cheap while getting full.
We order two plates: 1/ rice, daal, potatoes and chicken chaana; 2/ rice, daal and chicken tikka masala. Plus garlic naan and a coke. Everything for £15. I will repeat in case of coming back to Manchester.

---

veeery good food, a little spicy and very nice staff, loved it

---

Best curry in Manchester. I've been visiting since 1990. I'm going again today. Great food at a great price. Love it.
edit: As stated, went again today and it was marvellous. Keema, channa and spicy cabbage for £6.50. Where else in town can you eat like a King for that price in 2025?

---

No better place to eat in Manchester for less than a fiver, genuinely the best curry you can buy too. The curry mile can run a mile.

---

Lamb Nihari on a Sunday is one of the best things I've ever eaten. The best of the 'Rice & 3' places in the Northern Quarter.

---

Excellent Indian restaurant offering a wide range of curries which rotate on a daily basis , the 3 meat curry’s menu option is great as you can experience several great tasting curries All for a fantastic price point , Extras such as samosas and naan breads are also available which also taste great. Plenty of seating and in summer out door seating is available, don’t be decided by the location of the restaurant as the place is a complete gem , To conclude you won’t find a better value Indian meal anywhere in the Uk!

---

Heard a lot about here. didnt let us down.. really good food.

---

best food in the world

---

Amazing and friendly service, amazing food and very well priced! The meat is cooked perfectly and the sizes are just perfect

---

Great hidden treasure

---

Great place. Down a little alley. Cheap and cheerful food. The curry is very mild. You're out of luck if you want hot and spicy.

---

Spotted this gem on google maps and popped in for lunch. We ordered rice with chicken curry, lamb curry and cabbage for £8.50. Good portion size and was delicious! The lamb curry was spicier than I expected but tender and good.

Atmosphere wise it’s like a canteen with plenty of seats to enjoy your meal with friends. Overall the food was good and afforable, highly recommend trying it out if you fancy a simple and casual meal!

---

Quite literally one of the best restaurants I’ve ever been to. The food was delicious and the price was surprisingly cheap for what you would expect of quality Indian food. The customer service was fantastic as well as the staff are very welcoming and friendly. I was going to just order chicken tikka masala but the staff recommended I order the 3 meat for roughly the same price and I’m so glad I did because the mix of favors on the plate were incredible. Be sure to order the Lamb Mince Keema while you’re at it because I would’ve made the mistake of not getting it due to ignorance and it was great. Do yourself a favor and stop by This & That. You won’t regret it.

---

Been a customer for 20 yrs. Amazing food. Esp nihari on a sunday

---

Top place for cheap eats good flavour

---

Food here has always been great. Visited lots of times over the years and is always our go to lunch spot whenever in Manchester

---

Fantastic food, lovely staff, best  rice and 3, by far. Superb!

---

Arguably the best curry I've ever had. Phenomenal value for money too! Thank you, This & That, from your new South African friend.

---

Excellent, excellent indian food!

---

Reasonable price Food.
3 curries and rice for the right price helpful staff.
Wonderful experience

---

Amazing food, great value, lovely people. Highly recommend!

---

Fantastic food and price

---

Delicious curry, very affordable and would  highly recommend

---

Absolutely fantastic. Best Indian food me and my American fiancé have ever eaten.

---

Still the best eatery in town. Been coming here since 1983 with the Ferranti gang

---

Excellent

---

Taste is good and prices reasonable.

---

The best rice and three options i tried. This was a unique experience. Place is small but food is budgeted and tasty. Do try their vegetarian options

---

Cheep and cheerful. Great food, self serve and quick. I always love coming here for a lunch. Veggie options are delicious.

---

Can't even begin to explain how good this was. You know it's good when people are queuing outside after 5 minutes

---

The culinary highlight of our Manchester trip. Was so good the first time we had to go again. We have tried all the local 3 curries and rice and this is definitely the best, and the best value for money. I think vegetarian wise the chickpea and spinach were stand out. And the lamb karahi was lovely for meat. I will certainly be coming back.

---

Fantastic canteen-style Indian cafe which is ridiculously cheap given the quality of the food and friendliness of the staff. They also make dishes you won’t typically see on BIR menus - the highlight for me being an incredible liver and kidney curry.

---

The best Indian in Manchester hands down

---

Everything they say about this place is true!
It’s not fancy but by god it tastes nice!
It gets busy at dinner time but is well worth the wait!

---

Tiny place with a not so fancy ambiance.
Love how close to home the food here feels.
Also brilliant value for money!

---

Love this place. Great prices and excellent food

---

Don’t be scared if you try to find this place after dark. You might set your spidey senses tingling when you head into the alleyway this is in, but it’s worth the trip. Daily specials, the canteen coseyness and the price make this a very worthwhile effort

---

Cheap and cheerful, but excellent curry! I always try to visit when I'm in Manchester!

---

One of the best in Manchester.

---

Lives up to the hype. We didn't get rice and three only because Nehari was on the menu so we got a full portion of that. Delicious. Got mango lassi too which was very affordable and hit the spot. Can't wait to go back. Staff very upbeat and chatty.

---

legendary

---

Tucked out of sight but was surprised to see many people eating there. Tried it and was not disappointed, good value for money as well.

---

What an amazing place ! I was hesitant at first but the food was authentic and very tasty. 🤤 The service was pleasant but the food was surprising tasty. Very reasonably priced , I would have paid more. Sorry pictures of empty plates because it was too delicious.

---

Really good Indian Food, defo recommend, quiet spicy but that’s what you would expect from an authentic place. Staff was really friendly as well and price very reasonable!!

---

An absolute MUST try in Manchester, incredible food for an incredible price. You will not regret it

---

OMG LIKE BEST INDIAN FOOD EVER.The lamb to die for. Must try if in Manchester

---

Nice little place with a very basic setup and offerings. Food is good, and the clientele seem like a melting pot of cultures and classes. Not fine dining by a long mile, budget friendly basic 'mess' like place.

---

Iconic and best 3 rice and curry eatery hands down. Lovely food and lovely people.

---

A really good place to get Indian food at a good price in Manchester. They have different dishes everyday for you to choose from.

I ordered the Lamb Nehari, Keema (minced meat) and Chana (Chick Peas) to go with my rice. Personally I love their Lamb Nehari the most as the lamb is so soft and just wonderful.

I also highly recommend ordering the Mango Lassi. It is a mango flavored yoghurt drink priced at only £1. It goes well with the meal.

---

Great find all 3 currys where great a must in NQ hard to find but trust me a true hidden gem!

---

There's a 50% chance you’ll probably miss it or look at the dark alley and wonder - this can't be it...because this place is literally at the corner of an alley, blocked by bins from the bar or barrels.

But this is an absolute gem in Manchester! Nothing spectacular, simply basics and that's the beauty of it!

Set of curries with rice, good portions, great atmosphere and very reasonably priced...like £6-£7!

A proper DESI food, when you’re craving for chana daal, keema, or sabzi bhaji.

Great stuff! Since 1984.
And halal.

---

One of Manchester secret back street food places. Many years I have been coming here  and seen this place grow to be a must have place for food. Good price quick and easy and will always leave you mouth with a volcano of taste and flavours

---

Delicious 😋

---

Great curry, good prices, super chill atmosphere. Good place to pit stop or escape.

---

Been coming here for over a decade. There is always a queue because the food is always good. The people running this place are very kind and always happy to help.

---

Yum yum bloody yum 👍

---

This and That always delivers quick great tasting curry dishes as well as the famous rice+3!

---

Got this tip from a local Indian, cheap but tasty Indian food. Yum!

---

Absolutely amazing price for some really tasty food. I had three lovely vegan curries, a vegetable samosa, and a drink for just nine quid. Man, I wish this place existed in London too!

---

Love this place for a quick cheep feed of yummy curry. Always 3 veggie options

---

Popular for a reason. Accepts card too.

---

Lovely food - almost tastes like home cooked!

---

So so good :)

---

Amazing meal....rice with chicken tikka and paratha with lamb korma

The korma was perfectly spiced and the lamb was tender.

The chicken was tender and juicy with a delicious gravy.

Perfect weekday lunch treat

---

Excellent food, reasonably priced, recommended by a local. So good! I would eat here again!

---

£8 for 3 delicious curries and a Chapatti, what's not to love! I use a wheelchair and there's one big step to get in, it's small inside but the staff are Very accommodating.  If you can manage the step give it a go!

---

Absolute hidden gem of Manchester! Favourite place to eat in the whole of Manc such good quality of food and amazing price! Staff are so lovely! Must visit!

---

Been going here for years, great when you fancy a lunch time curry, always worth a visit!

---

The food is amazing! Really good value for money. Must visit

---

Great place serving excellent food. Rice and 3 curries £6-£7, what’s not to like? Good choice of meat and veg curry, bhajis, samosas and bread also on offer. Cafe style place no frills and great food.

---

Backalley cafe.. community vibe. ..awesome food and prices.

---

Food amazing. Not the place for a social more like eat and go. Love this place!

---

Dont be fooled by the dodgy side street entrance... Amazing service and delicious food. You are basically an arse if you find something to complain about. Will make this a regular eating spot.

---

Amazing food at bargain prices. Just left with the Mrs, both absolutely stuffed for 20 quid.

---

Great food!!

---

Great place and Mo says they do the best curry hangover cure

---

Scrumptious. This place has a perfect blend between well cooked fast food and value for money. I was recommended by a friend to try the rice and 3 curries. It's well worth the visit

---

Still the best food at a great price.

---

Back street basic curry cafe. Absolutely beautiful food, Cheap prices do not do the tastes and quality justice. Everyone should go there once in their lifetime, but I advise every week.

---

Superb as always.

---

Well recommend great curry and can mix 👌🏻👍🏻

---

Delicious as always. Very friendly.

---

Absolutely fantastic. friend told me about this and thank god he did.

---

An indian cafe serving a very tasty if limited range of fresh food. The cabbage curry was lovely. Well worth a try, but can be busy.

---

Quick, unfussy, cozy, delicious and affordable ✨

---

If you are looking for authentic curry for lunch this is the place to go.
Although it does not look like the fanciest of places, the good is very tasty and well priced.

---

Great place for a quick lunch. Good value.

---

Been eating here for many many years excellent service excellent food highly recommended

---

Cheap and tasty food. We spent no more than 5.5£ per person and we were full and satisfied. The dishes we tried: chicken curry, lamb karahi, chick peas, rice and onion baji. Everything was perfect except for the fact that the baji was at room temperature. Recommended.

---

Perfekt

---

Been going here for 20+ years and it’s always been bang on every time! Authentic Asian homemade currys ❤️

---

Best food and service i got in Manchester , it’s really a hidden gem

---

Comida muito saborosa e preço excelente (£6 a £8 libras). O restaurante é super simples e tem um buffet com diversas opções de curry, que mudam de acordo com o dia da semana. Tem naan fresco e o serviço é muito receptivo e agradável. Queria nunca ter conhecido o lugar, porque agora quero voltar toda semana. Recomendo muito!

---

This doesn’t look great but don’t judge a book by its cover This place is amazing!!! I’ve been 10+ times and every time I go it gets better and better. Best curry house in Manchester

---

I love this kind of mushy food!🤪 It’s so creamy. Any combination is excellent! A truly hidden gem in Manchester.

---

Fresh and delicious. Tastes like home cooking 😊

---

Great food n service also cheap

---

Hidden gem just around the corner from Manchester bus station. Amazing Indian food, friendly stuff and a lot of happy customers at all times a day. Been there on Friday around 6pm and did not wait at all.

The street looks shady but the food is great! Very cheap! 👌

---

Always great, food tastes wonderful and good portions.

---

The food was great, very nice portions and friendly staff, the best curry I’ve had.

---

First visit in over 20 years. If anything better

---

Love this little place. Very tasty food and friendly staff

---

Loved it, you've gotta try this place.

---

I came here today with my partner after he insisted I would love it...he was right!

If you are after an authentic Indian canteen style meal then this is your place! I worked for a month in a hospital in India and the restaurant was very similar, however the curries here are much tastier! Food was obtained very quickly by queuing to select your curry. The prices are excellent (£6-7 for 3x curries and rice) and i left feeling very full as the portion size was generous! The people serving were very friendly and it's clear they want to make your experience enjoyable!

Will definitely be back!

---

Ambiente senza pretese, personale super amichevole e cibo pazzesco!!!! Tutto molto buono e saporito, consigliatissimo.

---

Wow! Incredible food and amazing customer service. First place I visited when I arrived in Manchester, after seeing it recommended a lot online! What a welcome!!! Lovely staff, happy to chat and had lots of regulars - always a good sign! The food was SO tasty. Best keema curry I've ever tried. I had rice and three (2 meat and 1 veg) and a veg samosa - it was divine. Would go back in a heartbeat!
P.s. Such great value!!!

---

Another fabulous meal here. Wish I'd known about this place years ago. Food all ready to be served behind the counter. Tasty and lots of choice which changes daily. At least 3 veggie options. Highly recommended 🙂

---

Rice and 3 for £6 good deal

---

Love this place, the food is always amazing. Best curry in Manchester

---

Nice curries at cheap prices. Perfect for a quick lunch if you fancie some tasty indian/Pakistani Street food.

---

A hidden gem of Manchester with an array of dishes available. Portions are nice and large and the staff are very friendly. Would highly recommend!

---

Best cheap lunch spot in Manchester. £6.50 for rice, 2 veg curries and 1 meat curry. Different selection of curries available each day of the week. Quick, tasty, cheap.

---

Absolutely legendary place - never disappoints, top quality curry.

---

Breathtaking

---

I haven't been to this place is years since I moved out of the country, but I constsntly think of this place and how amazing the food was. If I ever fly back it's because of this place.

---

The best rice and three curry cafe in Manchester.

---

It's an institution for a reason

---

1st time here, what I hear you cry, well it won't be my last, quality food served and very reasonably priced only £10 for rice and 3 curries, 1 Roti and a bottle of water, where in the city centre can you get that, and we sat inside.
This place has been going years, there's a different set of curries everyday so you can plan which day you want to visit.

---

Great curry best in Manchester

---

Really friendly and amazing food

---

Definition of cheap and cheerful, no frills Indian canteen. Really good food too, good as any other curry house.

---

The most economical and the best match to the desi taste buds!!!!!

---

Consistently awesome for decades! Really nice staff too. Cheap as chips and the food is better than most Indian restaurants in Manchester.

---

The food is the best and the mango lassi must try

---

So glad that we did try this hidden gem. So much different to the taste of Indian food in NL (where we come from). So cheap. Good portion. Quick.
I can eat there every day I guess.
You can choose meals of choice (rice with one meat and two vegetables or rice with 3 meats dishes, etc). The place is small, but we didn't face problems eating lunch there with 7 of us.
The meals are at least medium spicy. So not suitable for young children.
Recommended!

---

A welcoming family-run canteen. Bus drivers on a lunch break share tables with unpretentious culinary explorers. Food was fresh and delicious for the price. 6£ for rice & three curries is truly a good deal.

---

Definitely a hidden Manchester gem.

---

No waiting, treated well and the food was as good as it gets. Well worth a visit. Will definitely be coming here more often.

---

Love this place, shame it isn't closer!

---

Love this place. Food always great and very cheap. No messing around just go in, eat, put your plate back and leave 💯

---

Can’t wait to visit again - so tasty, great service & amazing value. Superb 🥳

---

Do not walk past this place without ordering something

---

Serves the best curries in the country at an absolute bargain of value for money.  I'll happily travel over from Liverpool just to come get some for lunch since the price is so cheap and the food is so good.

---

Food is always excellent here, good value and friendly staff

---

First time - friendly staff, great service and delicious food. Thank you.

---

A place for great Indian food at reasonable price.

---

Perfect for exactly what it is. Cheap meals from a a set menu with a little spice. This is all I’m craving when I want a curry. We will return here probably every time we’re in Manchester. It’s a great price too! I love the seating style it feels like a cosy family feel.

---

Great value

---

Best Indian food at an affordable rates with great customer service one of my favourite places in shudhill I visit once a week

---

Absolutely delicious. Best quality food in Manchester on cheapest prices. Had Rice with two meat and vegetables and Mango Lassi. Great stuff.

---

Great quality sub-continental food, no fuss and at an affordable price. Would recommend.

---

This was so good that I forgot to take a photo before hand.

---

Amazing.

---

Bargain prices and tasty food, with nans/bread arriving in minutes after ordering.

Only issue is the cleanliness of the street outside could improve and maybe something that the cafe could deal with, as I expect the council doesn't bother sweeping it!

Ideal if you don't want a full-on Indian sit down experience and need a quick, informal lunch or dinner :)

---

🤌

---

💯

---

Probably one of the best Desi food here! Amazingly tasty. Hidden Gem

---

Always a treat. Warm wholesome food with a good atmosphere. Feels just like home.
Ask for the secret mo mo menu

---

A Manchester institution. Great spot for casual dining. Portions are always generous and the food is spot on.

---

Felt like eating at home. Owner was very kind. Ismail bhai, thank you for your hospitality, we will see you some day in Jogeshwari :)

---

This hole in the walk type place has very good Indian food. The people behind are excellent.  They may seem cold but understand they are busy. Visit after the rush hour, they are very friendly and warm. In fact they had made fresh kababs just for us. Prices are very reasonable. We visited during Cricket World cup (Jun '19) from USA and we still have good memories of this place.

Authentic amazing food

Mate who used to go on Manchester pub crawls told me about *This & That* adding that it was *authentic*. Didn't expect too much.
Been eating there at least once a month since 1997 & the food is great. I was brought up on South Indian food but really prefer Gujarati or Punjabi style (don't tell my Ma!).
The owner, Ishmael Malu, is a really nice guy and his son and staff too. Unfortunately, I called him Mr Alu for a long time before he gently corrected me (thought it was an odd name!).
We don't have similar eating places here in Liverpool where the local *Indian* restaurants seem to cook for drunk people -This & That caters for hungry people. Try it!

マンチェスターに来る機会があれば絶対に来ると思う。

영국에서 먹은 음식중 가장 맛있었습니다
가격도 8파운드로 너무 착해요
인디안 커리를 맨체스터에서 드실거라면 강추합니다.
+)못참고 2달뒤에 또왔다!
점심에 갔는데 사람짱 많음ㄷㄷ 10파운드 아래로 이렇게 먹는게 환상적
축구보러 맨체스터 온 한국인이면 꼭드시길
양파도 마음것 풀 수 있어서 좋아요:)
