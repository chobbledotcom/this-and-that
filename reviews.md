Excellent place for you to be able to get a meal..... fantastic food

---
Fantastic tasty food.Just what l needed on a cold day. Curries are amazing.The staff are very nice.

---
It's the best. Don't tell anyone please  :)

---
Best Indian food I've tasted outside of my home country, Malaysia. And the price is sooooo reasonable! During our second visit, they even offered us the mango lassi and mineral water for free. My friend got samosas for free as well! Such good hospitality and most importantly, good food!

---
Brilliant and great value.

---
Absolutely awesome food. Fresh and healthy. Would recommend any deshi(desi) people trying to find an unpretentious curry place that tastes gopd and budget-friendly.

Pro-tip: Chicken Masala and Spinach are spot on!

---
Best home cooked desi style food, cheap and amazing

---
Tiny place with a not so fancy ambiance.
Love how close to home the food here feels.
Also brilliant value for money!

---
Visited first time today, I had the 3 Curries, rice and a nan bread, big portion and the best curry I have tasted. Nice and clean place and helpful staff. Will definitely be back.

---
Well recommend great curry and can mix üëåüèªüëçüèª

---
Great food at a great price!

---
Can't even begin to explain how good this was. You know it's good when people are queuing outside after 5 minutes

---
Food is very delicious

---
MY BEST INDIAN RESTAURANT IN MANCHESTER! 5 stars

---
Rice and lamb curry. Honestly say no more...üòã

---
Wow wotta hidden gem in Manchester.. This place never disappoints. First n foremost this is a PAKISTANI food n a PAKISTANI restaurant not Indian as it states in the description. PAKISTANI üáµüá∞ remember the name..

EXCELLENT FOOD N GREAT CHOICE OF DISHES

---
Excellent curries in casual restaurant. Generous portions. I would eat here at least once a week if I lived here. Can't recommend strongly enough.

---
Great curry best in Manchester

---
Hidden food gem in the heart of Manchester, traditional rice and three toppings, absolutely delicious and absolutely Manchester. You haven't seen Manchester unless you have been here, so what are you waiting for?

---
Amazing vibe, cheap and delicious food. The lamb curry was delicious, so was the chicken tikka masala curry. I would skip the lamb/spinach curry next time, though, I think it's given me gastric distress. Would definitely go again.

---
Very decent and tasty. Not for a fancy night out, but good quality and price for a quick meal!

---
Excellent Indian canteen restaurant. Delicious food that is quick and convenient. Daily menu is on a board on the wall and essentially you buy three dishes and rice for ¬£6.00. On my last visit I had lamb chops, chicken curry, daal, a chapati and rice for ¬£6.30. Opened in 1984 and as popular as ever.

---
Hidden gem üíé

---
Yum full as f@rk

(Translated by Google) Delicious and I recommend it

Hidden gem üëå

Heard great things about This and That for years and even know the Casual Connoisseur twins who designed a T shirt in homage to their frequent trips to the place. Well worth hunting out (I ended up having to stoop to an all time low and speak to a traffic warden for directions, it's down alley by Trof in NQ) great food and flavours and not overly hot, great friendly service and a great price, what's not to like. Kids really liked it to and daughter not that fussed about Indian food usually. Will certainly be going back at some point.

---
Tasty, cheap and filling. Great food. Cheap. Could do with a bit more imagination with the veggie curry menu. Gets a bit crowded sometimes because it's so good.

---
Awesome lunch, "rice and three"

---
Fab food. Fab staff

---
Excellent curries,  good price,  friendly service.

---
After being recommended for Nihari on Sunday my conclusion this is One of the best hidden gems of Manchester. The tastiest and most affordable Asian/Indian food around. The staff is lovely and very quick.

Good options from both vegetarian and meat dishes to select from. You order at the counter by selecting dishes and then pay for your food. You can then select the salad and garnishing for your food and then take the food plate, cutlery and napkins along with the jug of water etc to your table. This place never disappoints! Remember it‚Äôs cash only ! Car payment option is not available.

---
Bit of a trek to find the pace. Not a fancy place at all but food was nice, luke warm. Staff were very friendly. Overall it is exactly as I expected. Well worth it for a quick and cheap eat.

---
No fuss, good tasting curry!

---
Love this place, shame it isn't closer!

---
Amazing food, service and prices. Definitely a must every time I‚Äôm in Manchester!

---
Best curry around. Staff are legends. Always come here and always will go back

---
Fantastic, good, cheap food

---
This is a great little play in the middle of town (Manchester) no fancy decor but the food is great and that's what matters. Been going since 1984 and always busy. Rice and three is big on the menu that's rice and 3 different curries. I'd recommend this place to anyone.

---
Scrumptious. This place has a perfect blend between well cooked fast food and value for money. I was recommended by a friend to try the rice and 3 curries. It's well worth the visit

---
Wow Unbelievable the service and food was amazing

---
Been coming here on & off for years like many others. You can‚Äôt argue with the food for the price.

---
Incredible spot. Just went there the one time, but had really tasty curry for an unbeatable price. The service was good and you can tell this place is very authentic, no attempts to be hip or trendy. Great on vegetarian/vegan options too!

---
This & that is a real hidden gem, family run, delicious food (every time) and really cheap!

---
Good curry at great prices!

---
Excellent food and excellent quality üëå

---
Absolute love! I have known this place for a few years now and it‚Äôs never disappointed. The spice is right, a great selection of different curries served canteen style. Great atmosphere, real people, gorgeous food and a small price. Stop reading and go there :)

---
Good prices and nice food. Disappointed with the onion bahjis and naan bread.

---
Best indian food

---
Working-class canteen vibes serving delightfully flavourful and heartwarming curry's. Portions are big enough to get you through the week. Always go for 3 curries for the variety. Never say no to the crispy bhajis on offer.

---
Very good affordable food, highly recommend.

---
Decent food at the extra decent prices. A delight.

---
Delicious curry, very affordable and would  highly recommend

---
amazing food and nice staff

---
This place is a hidden gem, they do a thing that I have only seen in Manchester (but I suspect has come from other places) called "rice and three". You have a plate of rice then you choose three of the set menu curries to put on top. They are all made very mild as you add your own chilli and coriander after you buy it. It is also cheap, no fancy trimmings, just a canteen vibe and lovely staff and excellent food. The menu is set and is at the end of the servers bar printed on glass, which shows you how much it doesn't change.

---
Hidden jem!

---
Place doesn't look too inviting but must admit curry was very tasty!

---
Beautiful food at a really good price. Lots of choice, even for a vegetarian. I think the onion bhaji was the best I've ever tasted.

---
Top notch grub - defo visit

---
Very tasty, big portion, great price üòÅ

---
Love this place. Food always great and very cheap. No messing around just go in, eat, put your plate back and leave üíØ

---
Amazing food, no ego. Easily my favourite Indian restaurant

---
Perfect backstreet Indian cafe!

This place serves up fresh, great value food that hits the spot and caters for every diet.
The staff are very friendly and lively too which makes a difference.

Recommend coming here after a day in town or post work!

---
This restaurant was all we wanted - affordable, home made, indian food with fast and friendly service. Not the most amazing indian food but it is amazing for the price. A tad on the spicy side for our children but overall a great experience! And they threw in a free cookie and brownie as well! Great evening out.

---
Is by far the best place for a curry in Manchester. This and That is probably my most visited restaurant and with good reason. The food is always excellent, the people are so friendly and price is great.

If you haven't been before, don't let the canteen style put you off, it only adds to the charm.

---
Consistently outstanding food I have been going here for years no place beats it the best three curries & rice in Manchester and definitely the best keema in Manchester ! Everyone loves This and That 

---
Best curry cafe in Manchester for decades. And today's lunch reconfirms this is still the case. Brilliant food. 2 Rice and Three's, 2 seekh kebabs, 2 chapatis and a can for a ridiculous ¬£17. 

---
Great food

---
I was so happy to see that this place is still open. It is without doubt the best Indian cuisine in Manchester. 

---
Such good value for money. Really good for a quick meal. The staff are also really nice and helpful 

---
Amazing food amazing prices 

---
Just as I remembered from the early nineties. Food just as good and a nice variety every day. Thursdays are a good day. 

---
Nice little eatery in the middle of Manchester! Great authentic Indian food. Superb value! 

---
Just been down to manchester for family visit big shout out to the staff for fab food to take home to Scotland thank yu. 

---
Cheap and cheerful. 

---
Can't express what a saviour this place is to have in the northern quarter when your low on funds. Perfect scran for any occasion and you almost don't want to show anyone in case more people come to it. Veggie options just as good as meat and I'll never say no to going. 

---
fantastic food, great people 

---
It's an institution for a reason 

---
Always top class food, what you see is what you get

---
Saag gosht and keema gosht were stunning. Love the extra chillies at the counter as well. Great texture, spice level and depth of flavour.

---
Excellent food at low prices 

---
One of Manchester secret back street food places. Many years I have been coming here  and seen this place grow to be a must have place for food. Good price quick and easy and will always leave you mouth with a volcano of taste and flavours

---
Consistent high quality food and cheap prices. Friendly service, too. Absolutely recommended üëç 

---
Good food, cheap and comes close to the experience of a cheap eatery in the streets of India with all the added hygiene and cleanliness. Recommend.

---
Great food, so tasty. Staff were lovely and friendly too. Will be going back soon.

---
I couldn‚Äôt ask more for what I got here, authentic Indian curry, great value and delicious. Very happy having this India cuisine in this diversity city.

---
This and that is a great place to eat

My family favourite is nihari the Sunday special unfortunately a couple of times they have changed the taste which was disappointing but we went today and it was back to its best

---
Great food, the tikka masala and the lentil dal were delicious. Also affordable and welcoming staff!

---
Picture doesn‚Äôt do it justice. I have been visiting this place for 15 years and has been probably the most consistently good food place I have ever been to.

---
Everything was amazing. We tried both, vegetarian and meat options and everything was very tasty. I definitely recommend it. Tasty food, big portions and good prices.

---
Delicious cheap freshly cooked food- been around fur 30 years . Hidden gem

---
Gotta say food is better here than most of restaurants I have ever tried! Really authentic flavours. Naan was light & fluffy. Really friendly service ‚ù§Ô∏è wish this was in London

---
This hole in the walk type place has very good Indian food. The people behind are excellent.  They may seem cold but understand they are busy. Visit after the rush hour, they are very friendly and warm. In fact they had made fresh kababs just for us. Prices are very reasonable. We visited during Cricket World cup (Jun '19) from USA and we still have good memories of this place.

---
Absolutely loved it ‚ù§

Food was really nice

Staff are great.will defo return soon.üëç

---
Good food, friendly staff, and quick service - all at a very reasonable price!

---
I've been a regular for over 20 years, simply amazing.

Faster than a macdonalds, healthier than a macdonalds, cheaper than a macdonalds, tastier than a macdonalds. Got served a plate full of awesome in 30 seconds.

---
Nice rice and three. Beautiful and Lovely. Highly rated. Please visit

---
I've only been coming here since 1990... I love it.

---
Best curry ever, ive been going for over 15 years

---
Best curry house going

It's a basic shop but fabulous food

Good staff too

---
Great food and great service, always a pleasure to see Sohail :)

---
Great place, great food and value! A hidden gem

---
Still the best eatery in town. Been coming here since 1983 with the Ferranti gang

---
Wow! My husband normally has this with the lads at work as a treat on lates once in a while. As the Christmas holidays were upon us. I decided to sample it myself, with the husband tagging along of course ;) I think he would be furious if I left him out, as it is now one of his firm favourites. I have to say, I was completely sold from the first month full. Amazing quality, quantity and value for money. You don't often see those three words in the same sentence. I can't wait to try this again and sample some more delights.

---
Authentic great value tasty food, Corey recommend it more!!

---
Just an AWESOME experience, and Mo who was serving us was also amazing! Thank you, I‚Äôll defo come again and recommend it!

For the French, Allez-y c‚Äôest fantastique! De la vraie cuisine indienne √† ce prix, dingue!

---
The claim is correct. A hidden gem. Well worth seeking out.

---
This is the must try resturant in Manchester. Great food and great portion which you won't expected in other resturants in town, esp in such a downtown area. I had lamb and chicken which were really tender and nice. The lamb meat is juicy and tender and tasty, not too spicy. What impressed is the owner who worked in the shop for 35 years and still working during Covid. Even he mentioned the customers were only half of the crowd, he still keeps the same quality of the food. He worth our applause and respect.

---
Absolutely amazing shop, top Quality products and service.

---
I have just had my first curry from This and That, It tasted so much I am very impressed, can't wait to go again.

---
The place offers a large range of delicious food. I love eating here. Employees are always very welcoming, rates are affordable and the spot is always kept clean.

---
Delicious food, friendly staff.

---
Some of the best curry in the city. Well worth the detour for

---
The best nehari I have ever had .

---
A hidden gem of Manchester with an array of dishes available. Portions are nice and large and the staff are very friendly. Would highly recommend!

---
A Manchester institution. Great spot for casual dining. Portions are always generous and the food is spot on.

---
Always a treat. Warm wholesome food with a good atmosphere. Feels just like home.

Ask for the secret mo mo menu

This spot is worth a visit. They have big portions for affordable prices. Consistently neat and with excellent atmosphere. I highly recommend this place.

---
Amazing food, great people, love it.

---
Straight forward budget Indian food.  Everything I had was tasty. I'll go again.

---
Lovely food and staff it's great when you cannot be asked cooking for 1 while hubby is away for work and can pick up comfort food on your way to work to make your night shift go quicker with good food see you soon

---
Best place for quick freshly made food. The lamb Nahari on Sundays is better than any I've had before.

---
Ordered a hamper, excellent value for money for such tasty food. The guys that served us were very friendly & welcoming. This will NOT be our last visit.

---
Amazing food, nothing more to say, it's a must, get yourself down there for the most tasty food at cheap prices, you will not be disappointed x

---
Amazing place highly recommend the food best place ever

---
All ways fresh  food  you can get from thus place

---
Great value good food

---
The food was absolutely amazing and the owners were extremely friendly and kind! Will surely come back to this place!

---
The three curries dish is a must.

---
Wife and I decided on This and That for Sunday lunch.

Rice and three meats / Rice, two meats and one Veg / garlic naan / 2 bhajis / two cans - ¬£16.80

Fantastic value, probably the tastiest Indian take away in the City!

The lamb nahari and the lamb w/ spinach were excellent!

Thank you guys

---
Already made curry dishes. Got tasty and fresh. Not spicy but sauces available. Good value and quick

---
Best scran in Manchester.

---
Love the food. Staff is really nice and caring. A place with history and rich flavours. Busy during lunch time.

---
Believe the hype. The best curry in town

---
Just as I remembered from the early nineties. Food just a just and a nice variety every day. Thursdays are a good day.

It‚Äôs not just about the food which is just plain tasty by the way, it‚Äôs about the people behind the counter as well. Though I‚Äôve only been in only a couple of times as I‚Äôm travelling from Glasgow the staff are genuinely nice people.

It‚Äôs not just about money in this place as they can charge more than what they are charging as it is completely worth it. I‚Äôve a feeling they‚Äôre doing this for the community they are in so more people can afford it.

While walking past other shops that are quiet which is a shame in these COVID stricken times ,there is a slow steady stream of customers coming into this establishment.

Maybe not just for the food I‚Äôve witnessed but for the natter and feeling of family you get from mo and Ismail.

I‚Äôm pretty well travelled and have ate in a lot of places but the kebab here must be one of the best value ones in the uk. None of that mushed fake Lamb gubbins they serve elsewhere but here it‚Äôs proper meat that‚Äôs been cooked on a skewer then chargrilled.

Will be back.

---
Fantastic gem, should not be overlooked if you like curry

---
Tucked away down a tiny back street is this gem. The food is simple & down to earth, with no frills, but it is absolutely top notch. You must go here. üëç

---
Nice fish and chips. Fast service. Not a big menu to choose from . The place has just been refurbished. Looks nice. Absolutely first class. Traditional fish and chips easily the best in the area. In fact these are the best fish and chips I've had, and I've had a few.

---
The food was amazing, and the staff/owners were very helpfull, next time im in Manchester I will definitely return.

---
Awesome food , desi memories üòã

---
Excellent food and cheap! Traditionally cooked- been around for 20 plus years

---
This place is no doubt the best and most authentic indian food there is in the entire Manchester or maybe UK. If you‚Äôre not scared of spice, come to this place. It might not have the best interior and setup but come here for food and not for vibe! Just the flavors and spices make up for everything! Totally would eat here everyday if I can.

---
Fantastic sport hidden away in Manchester.   Food here is authentic and very homely.  Around lunchtime it is almost impossible to find a place to sit.  it is cafeteria style sit down so you may sit with a few strangers.  You could take your food to go.  But this is definitely finger licking good for veg option or non veg option.

---
THE BEST!!!!So lucky to have bumped into this little Gem!Amazing food, friendly staff, incredible value for money! ‚Ä¶

---
THE BEST!!!!

So lucky to have bumped into this little Gem!

Amazing food, friendly staff, incredible value for money!

I wish there will be a place like this in Glasgow!

cannot wait to go back and try all the delicious dishes!!!!

---
THANKS A LOT THIS AND THAT! you are the best!

---
Abousltley brilliant food went with my daughter and grandaughter will definitely go again

---
Great and cheap Indian cuisine, lovely employees. Will definitely come back!

---
Been going here for years, great when you fancy a lunch time curry, always worth a visit!

---
Freshly made homey Indian food

---
Great little place that serves rice and curry.  Plenty of different choice of curries on offer as well as kebabs and samosas however their speciality is rice and curry.  Mix and match meat and vegetable curries to create a fusion of different flavours.  Their reputation and popularity has spread by word of mouth which is the best form of advertising.

---
Amazing food, amazing people, I‚Äôve come here over the years now and it‚Äôs still is one of the best spots for some authentic Indian food. If you are ever in Manchester check this place out, you won‚Äôt regret it and the prices are so reasonable also.

---
I heard about this place a lot was visiting Manchester thought give it try great price and good portion of food hard to find food is ok nothing really special more hidden gems like this place in Yorkshire the food I'm used to.

---
Awesome food

---
Good food. Reasonably priced

---
Had a lovely meal very friendly staff highly recommended that is if you could find the place hidden gem

---
All I can say is that i genuinely can't enjoy food from other restaurants now I have eaten here, the only place I have ate curry in the last 4 years

---
Lovely people, lovely food, amazingly cheap

---
Good place for casual South Asian food. The place gets busy from 12 pm onwards and become hard to find a seat. Overall very good place for people from Bangladesh, India and Pakistan.

---
Never been here.!

Saturday august the 08th at Bolton train station at appx 10.30 pm. One of your staff kindly got us a cab to Bury and helped us out with some change to give to the taxi driver for our journey when we thought we didnt have enough.

Bravo to you my friend and will one day soon pay the same respect to you .

Thank you so very much you are a true gentleman.

---
Amazing food, great value, lovely people. Highly recommend!

---
Best curry in manni

---
Hats off for the food it was brilliant, highly recommend this place!!!

---
One of my favourite places for a quick varied curry in Manchester City centre. All food is kept hot and you pick and choose. Authentic. Lots of vegetarian options. Shared tables. Tucked away down a side street. Don‚Äôt take your maiden aunt.

---
Decent food at a reasonable price

---
Amazing Currys. Very good quality food served in a spontaneous staff environment. Love to have my lunch breaks there.

---
Tasty food. Excellent value. Vegetarian / vegan options. Great ambience and you get your food in a flash. No nonsense. Highly recommended.

---
Cheap and tasty food. We spent no more than 5.5¬£ per person and we were full and satisfied. The dishes we tried: chicken curry, lamb karahi, chick peas, rice and onion baji. Everything was perfect except for the fact that the baji was at room temperature. Recommended.

---
Highly recommended

---
Would surely recommend visiting this place. Great ambience, delightful food, awesome service. Highly recommended.

---
Always excellent food

---
The most economical and the best match to the desi taste buds!!!!!

---
Top food. Can't beat it

---
heard so much about this place and finally managed to find it. on first looks it seems like a place not to be trusted but this family business is amazing and has so many multiple food awards and once you taste the food you know why that is so you don't mind paying that slightly higher price. The portion sizes are great and the I always get the the same dish and its just perfect and you can tell others are enjoying them selves too. great atmosphere of everyone loving food and its one of very few places where I have seem so many people from different ethnic backgrounds go and enjoy the same food. PERFECT

---
Great food at this place

---
Wonderful curry and lovely staff. Let me off a quid when I didn‚Äôt have the right change too

---
Best secret back alley place in Manchester!

---
Worth every penny spent. Awesome delicious hot Indian food. Highly recommended.

---
Excellent food at a great price. Nice atmosphere.

---
Never disappoints. Rice and three veggie curries for ¬£4.50 served with a smile. What more can I say! Fast food at its finest

---
Fantastic authentic curry selection. Simple menu but still enough options.

---
A staple! I couldn't possibly say enough good things about this restaurant, it is one of my favourite places and arguably the best curry in Manchester! I have eaten here more times than I could count, at some points twice in the same week! Amazing quality and GREAT value for money.

---
Still the best food at a great price.

---
Love this place, decent food tucked away in a side street. Has been there for many years. Definitely recommend.

---
Friendly, informal with lovely food.  Not oily and only mildly spicy but very tasty

---
Always reliable, good honest food, authentic,  and value for money. Very cafeteria in its style, basic decor and furniture. Great for a quick lunch. For this location, northern quarter, it is the best Indian offering for lunchtimes.

---
If you want tasty and cheap food in the middle of the Manchester city centre, this is the go to place.

---
So glad I called in to try after reading about this place. I only wish we had something similar up in the Newcastle area. Absolutely fantastic food and great value for money too

---
Great place hidden on Soap Street. Fantastic choice of curries, lots of possible combinations; rice with three vegetable curries or two veg one meat, two meat one veg or three meat. Around a fiver depending on combination. Add a fresh roti for 80p. One of the best curry houses in central Manchester. Well worth a visit...

---
Food ok I couldn't eat.it all  reasonable priced . Was my 1st.time there

---
This hidden gem is the best known of several similar outlets in Manchester's northern quarter. Don't let the plastic chairs and Formica tables put you off, the food is amazing. Nothing like your usual Indian restaurant, these curries are proper, no-nonsense, delicious and spicy. Feels like authentic food. Always a choice with good veggie selection. Makes my mouth water just thinking about it!

---
Outstanding quality and quantity. Got there at quarter past 4 on Monday on our way to the Iron Maiden concert. A full, and I mean full, plate of 4 curries with rice for ¬£5.50. It's no frills but it doesn't need any, the food speaks for itself. Quite tricky to find, but worth persevering for.  I'll be back.

---
Great food, affordable prices. Definitely I will come back again.

---
Highly recommended! Freshly cooked daily, you'll want to go back, amazing price!

---
My favourite place. I go once a week. Friendly people and great vegan options

---
Terrific hole in the wall joint, no frills just excellent comfort food. Dishes rotate daily, so you'll never be bored with multiple visits.

---
Excellent food and excellent service I would definitely recommend this restaurant

---
A really good & cheap Indian place. Everything's basically under ¬£6. Amazing people, great service.

---
One of my favourite rice and 3 curry places in the NQ. Amazing value and authentic.

---
Top quality authentic no frills dining experience. Slightly tricky to find, down an alleyway, but well worth it. Three curries and rice. You can't go wrong.

---
Great food, great service, great prices! Down a small street and maybe doesn't look much from outside, but don't let that put you off!

---
Is a nice place, for a quick and cheap food. However is quite hidden away. But the staff is nice and is worth visiting.

---
Best curry in Manchester by a mile

---
Best small restaurant in manchester staff friendly food excellent prices very reasonable

My grandson loves it

---
Tasty and very authentic food. They were happy to give when asked for some extra Curry. Will recommend at least once. I couldn't find such a tasty Lamb Nehair anywhere else

---
You won't find a better meal for a fiver.

---
Amazing place, great value, very tasty, no frills, just lovely food.

---
Hidden gem. Best value for money. Sunday nehari is the best

---
Delicious curry, cheap, good portions. The people are nice and friendly and I love the atmosphere there.

---
best curry in manchester! came back twice for this. awesome food at great price!

---
Well if you are visitor or a local of manchester and you dont know this place. Then I must say you haven't researched the places to eat in Manchester. If you read the reviews on trip advisor you will know what I mean. Place has been refurbished in the last year. They serve set items on set days.

---
Good food with less spices n nice n warm place.

---
Lovely people, amazing food. Highly recommend

---
This was so good that I forgot to take a photo before hand.

---
Amazing

---
Great value for money. Real basic layout. 3 choices of curry and rice - top price  ¬£6.50

---
tasty curry. nice people

---
Good curry, great price. Hidden gem. Very straightforward cafeteria-esque system, you get your food fast and cheap.

---
A Manc institution and quite rightly so. Great food, great prices.

---
Loved this place! Cash only. Good food. Very cheap.

---
As good as it was 20years ago, just could do with a few mild curries getting a wimp in my 40s but always enjoy a blast when I visit Manchester from Bolton with my twin x

---
Greatest rice and 3 in Manchester! Choose rice and a choice of 3 seperate curries for around ¬£5. You can't go wrong

---
Usually I hit up the lamb dishes these days.  Be sure to sprinkle plenty of chopped onions. It's cheap and cheerful but very delicious and feels nourishing.

---
Amazing curries for a fair price with lovely people in a chilled atmosphere

---
Delicious food made by the same family since 1984. Friendly, welcoming staff,  generous portions around a fiver. A hidden gem.

---
It is an Indian restaurant  run by an Indian from Gujrat.The restaurant is a very ordinary joint.Food is fresh and decent.The team serving there is quite courteous.Both Veg and Non Veg food is served with limited choice.    It is more like a set     menu at a reasonable cost.

---
Back here for the first time this Century, accompanied by a 20 year old daughter i didn't even have back then!  Spent nearly every lunchtime of my early working life here and its great to see the spirit and food hasn't changed one bit.  Still the best - Daughter was equally impressed.

---
Squashed and a little uncomfortable, but the food is fabulous and very very cheap, for such a central location. Will be back, many times

---
Exceptional quality food. Cheap and filling.

---
Absolutely delicious.

---
Nice indian food in the city of Manchester. Located very near to the northern quarter area, this place serves the freshly cooked rotis along with indian curries and rice. Very reasonable in terms of pricing and it's a nice option if you are looking for curries and rice in Manchester.

---
Hands down, the best vegetarian curries in Manchester also the cheapest I have found. They cycle through different dishes throughout the week so you get something a little different from one day to the next. Yum yum in my tum!

---
I got to This & That every working day for a rice and three veg curry and a chapatti for ¬£4.20 - it is amazing. I have been going for over 20 years and have never got bored! The decor is simple and functional but the food is amazing. Proper healthy curry like your mum would make! And the staff are friendly too. I can't recommend This & That enough :)

---
Good if you want a dash lunch with no frills!

---
Ive been here about 4/5 times now. The food generally is pretty tasty, you get big plate fulls too. However, the seating is very limited due to the size of the restaurant, quite often you are squeezed up close to other people and don‚Äôt have any elbow room. Once you‚Äôre done you should leave as people will need you too move as it gets so busy.

---
Good if you want a dash lunch with no frills!

---
Always been my favourite place. Rice and 3 for under ¬£7. Fresh roti. It's just the best place.

---
Heard a lot about here. didnt let us down.. really good food.

---
Lamb Nihari on a Sunday is one of the best things I've ever eaten. The best of the 'Rice & 3' places in the Northern Quarter.

---
the absolute best way to describe this place is - you know walking home you smell some great cooking and you wish you could be invited in, but you arent and you go home and order a take out but its resturant food and not anything like the home cooking.... WELL THIS PLACE DOES INVITE YOU IN. IT IS THE GREAT HOME COOKED SMELL YOUR SMELLING. I kept hearing great things. From everyone from every walk of life. it is exceptional. everyone is welcome and everyone will love what they have cooked. Home cooked style. so incredibly good value. such amazingly kind and dedicated people.

---
Cheap, fast, beautiful food and great staff.

---
Almost don't want to leave a review because it's tucked out of the way down an alley, and feels like your own little secret curry place. Fantastic value for money though, and delicious authentic Indian food. No messin'

---
An unpretentious little restaurant, easy to miss down an alleyway. Great tasting food and the staff were really friendly - the prices were very reasonable too.

---
We went to 'This & That's yesterday (Friday) at around 3pm - instantly welcomed by the staff, and we were even given samples of the food to make sure it wasn't too spicy for us before we ordered. The food was incredible, and the service was first-class. A great little independent restaurant which deserves to be visited by anyone looking for authentic, great-tasting Indian food. 5-stars!

---
I really enjoyed it. Is a very simple indian place with home mad currys meals. They all taste good and seems to be cooked in an authentic way. There is a menu which changes for every day of the week. For the quality is absolutely cheap

---
Amazing food, lovely friendly people.

---
Best curry in Manchester!

---
Practically a Mancunian institute and you should eat here at least once in your life if you live in the city.  It won't be the best curry you've ever had, or the most grandiose place you've ever eaten but you will get great tasting food at a great price.  Serving since 1984 and there is a reason they've been open for over 30 yearsMenu choices vary depending on day of the week, good vegetarian options.

---
Always great, food tastes wonderful and good portions.

---
A really authentic treat. Excellent value, super food cooked to perfection in a no frills, central, 'hidden' location.

---
Please please do a This and That Recipe book!

---
Have been going to This and That with my Mum since the 80's. We don't live in Manchester anymore so we always stop by when we're in town. I love the food here so much. Friendly warm and genuine place. You don't truly know Manchester until you've been here!!

---
Rice and three, great veggie food and meat options too.Great Value.

---
Please please do a This and That Recipe book!

---
Great traditional Asian food served to any and all groups of people from Asian families to besuited business men alike.

---
Just brilliant. Tasty and cheap. Chef is a massive BWFC supporter too.

---
Serves the best curries in the country at an absolute bargain of value for money.  I'll happily travel over from Liverpool just to come get some for lunch since the price is so cheap and the food is so good.

---
Amazing food for a very good price üëåüèΩüëåüèΩüëåüèΩ dont be fooled by the basic set up and plastic chairs etc. This is a good meal served hot and fresh. Lovely.

---
Excellent curries, a 30- year old Northern Quarter legend for a good reason. There is a good selection of both vegetable and meat curries, with 3 curries on rice costing between 4-6¬£, it's value for money and absolutely delicious to boot. And the portions huge as well, what's not to love?! :))

---
It's a great taste with a great value

---
Reasonabley priced great food.

---
Such good food v cheap, must go

---
Amazing food can't recommend it enough.

---
Fantastic place.   No frills, top quality food at very very reasonable prices.  I'll definitely be returning.

---
Fantastic food and price

---
Fantastic place. Been going here for ages. It just keeps getting better. Shame I don't work in Manchester anymore otherwise I'd be in here 3 times a week. My only place for lunch when I'm in town.  My favourite day is Tuesday, but you'll find something each day to tantalise your taste buds.  Staff are really friendly and the food is great. Get there soon. You'll enjoy!

---
Great food , good price, veggie curry's suitable for vegans

---
Amazing food, and brilliant staff. I have been going here for years and the service has always been fantastic.

---
Just tried liver and kidney, amazing

---
Everything they say about this place is true!

It‚Äôs not fancy but by god it tastes nice!

It gets busy at dinner time but is well worth the wait!

---
Amazing food. Would recommend getting at least one veg. With 2 meat. Typical order is rice 2 meat and 1 veg. Only 5 pound for 2 veg and 1 meat!!!

---
Amazing food.  Not only for the price but hands down.  Especially in the very heart of the city centre.

Always a diverse mix of people eating here proves how popular it is with everyone.

Highly recommended.

---
Amazing. More food than you can eat for under a fiver!? And all delicious!? Sign me up. I've been here a few times and the choice of the rice and three is always great. 10/10.

---
Great curries. Simple tasty.  Welcoming staff.  A must of a quirky place if you are visiting Manchester

---
Really good value for money as the portions are huge compared to the price you're paying though the taste of the food is on a blander end of the spectrum and the ventilation could use some improvement.

---
Brilliant place, great selection and seriously good value, the food is superb

---
Best rice and three in town.

---
What can I say? No frills but unbelievable value. 4 curries and rice on one plate for ¬£5.50. We arrived at 16:15 and had the same choice as on the menu. Fresh cooked rice whilst we waited. Friendly staff who certainly know how to make you welcome. Huge portions at low prices, I'll be back next time I'm oop north!!

---
The place looks a little bit old from outside but the food is delicious, i strongly recommend it. However, you cannot pay via credit card, only cash.

---
Great food!

---
My first visit will definitely not be the last. Great asian diner. Fantastic tasty currys. Great value. 3 currys, rice and nan for ¬£7. Food was full of flavour. Will be returning.

---
Loved it, you've gotta try this place.

---
Very nice rice and three. Great price.  Will be back . Would recommend. Excellent

---
Love this place! Great owners and we love the atmosphere inside. The food is always amazing.

---
Authentic Indian style rice and verities of curry..served by experienced chef. good food in the heart of Manchester

---
No better place to eat in Manchester for less than a fiver, genuinely the best curry you can buy too. The curry mile can run a mile.

---
Canteen style, cheap and cheerful. Always atleast 3 veggie curries.

Wonderful home cooked food, spices just right and curry not swimming in oil. Certainly go there again.

---
Lovely cosy place. The curries are amazing they taste just like homemade ones.

---
Not been for years still as good as I remember   .. rice and 3 in a canteen style ... great value

---
Amazing food. Will give 5 stars when the walls are cleaned :(

---
Simple, good quality food. Served fresh in a communal environment. One of Manchester's hidden little gems

---
Yummy and cheap.  Pay the man, take your food, seat yourself, eat, enjoy.  Total hole-in-the-wall and totally great.

---
A  little hidden gem in Manchester's Northern Quarter. Good quality food for a bargain price. Staff are lovely too. I will definitely be going back!

---
Dont be fooled by the dodgy side street entrance... Amazing service and delicious food. You are basically an arse if you find something to complain about. Will make this a regular eating spot.

---
Great curries and affordable too. Well worth a visit! No frills.

---
Consistently awesome for decades! Really nice staff too. Cheap as chips and the food is better than most Indian restaurants in Manchester.

---
Very tasty food in a ‚Äòno frills‚Äô environment which suited us fine. The staff were incredibly friendly and genuine. It came to ¬£18 for three large plates of food, a Nan bread, onion barji and a coke!

---
Delicious curries. Great for a quick meal, lunch deal is ¬£3.90 for 3 vegetarian/vegan curries with rice (costs more for meat). Will definitely be coming back

---
Absolutely love this place. Getting my lunch here regularly because of its vicinity, value for money, friendly staff and delicious curry.

Amazing curry and amazing prices!

Rice and 3 Curry's, hearty traditional meals, very tasty and affordable

Best hotel I ever ate in Manchester. It serves authentic Indian food.

Best rice and three place in town

The original Rice and Three Curries cafe. Brilliant!
