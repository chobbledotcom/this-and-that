When asked about what makes Spice & Spirits special, general manager Reshan Nagarkoti said they will "tailor things to exactly what the customers want".

The Little Hulton restaurant on Manchester Road has won the "Best of Manchester" award at the English Curry Awards and has been attracting customers from across the country for the past five and a half years.

Owner Bhavesh Patel opened the restaurant with head chef Ronit running the kitchen, and they've since opened a second branch in Bolton.

The restaurant also features a sports bar with screens showing major sporting fixtures, combining curry with entertainment.
