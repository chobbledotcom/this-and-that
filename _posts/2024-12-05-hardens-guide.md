**"A large number of Manchester’s restaurants have been included in a prestigious guide celebrating the very best places to eat in the country.**

Published each year and now in its 34th edition, Harden’s Best UK Restaurants guide is considered to be one of only two surviving established UK restaurant guides made available in print - and is the only one based on feedback from diners as opposed to professional inspectors.

Featuring 2,800 restaurants across the country spanning all types of budgets from street food vendors to fine dining establishments, the 2025 guide features around 50 Greater Manchester venues - including hotel spots, bars, pizza joints, food halls and celeb haunts.

To go alongside the guide, a top 100 list is also published which recognises the very best of the very best in terms of the country’s offerings. For Manchester, only Mana, on Blossom Street in Ancoats, made it on to the list - but rose to a very respectable 29th place after ranking at 97 last year. Home to the city's only Michelin Star, Mana was hailed as being ‘exceptional from start to finish’.

[...]

This & That, which has taken on the nickname of ‘Manchester's favourite Indian curry houses’ also gets a welcomed mention. The city centre establishment, on Soap Street, has been serving its authentic dishes since 1984 and is cited by many as the home of the ‘rice and three’."
