"Manchester's curry cafes deserve an article in their own right and, while there's some debate over the very best, we always find ourselves going back to This & That. Tucked away on Soap Street in the Northern Quarter, this family-run restaurant is beloved for its ‘rice and three’, which handily comes in for less than a tenner .

Sample dish: Lamb Steak, chicken and minced lamb with rice"
