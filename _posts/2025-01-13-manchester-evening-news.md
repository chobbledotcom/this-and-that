"Manchester's curry cafes hold legendary status in this city, and it seems like everyone has their favourite. One that we always find ourselves going back to is This & That. Tucked away on Soap Street in the Northern Quarter, this family-run restaurant is known for its ‘rice and three’, which handily comes in at under a tenner. Serving up a hungry lunch crowd seven days a week, curries here are constantly changing, keeping customer's interest piqued."
