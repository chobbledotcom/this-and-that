> One popular NQ curry caff is now doing deliveries

We all miss going out to restaurants, but many of our favourite places have adapted quickly in setting up [takeaway and delivery options](https://confidentials.com/manchester/delivering-food-and-drink-in-greater-manchester-2020). Curry caff favourite This & That have now created special ‘curry hampers’ for collection or delivery to addresses ‘within the M60.’

The family-run curry canteen, tucked away down Soap Street in Manchester’s Northern Quarter, opened back in 1984 and has since become an institution to [those in the know](https://confidentials.com/manchester/rice-n-three-a-manchester-cheap-eats-institution). "Even if you look for it, you won’t find it," says owner Ismail Mallu, who runs the tiny restaurant with his son Mohsin (or Mo as he’s better known.) "You have to first come with someone who knows us." 

The This & That team has been cooking up home-style curries for the residents and workers of Manchester for decades - they even cooked for Tom Parker Bowles, who wrote [a favourable review.](https://confidentials.com/manchester/tom-parker-bowles-in-manchester-the-impossible-dream-is-old-news) Even during the immediate aftermath of the [Manchester Arena bombing](https://confidentials.com/manchester/manchester-arena-terror-attack-captured-in-video) in 2017, they kept their doors open so they could feed the police and emergency services for free.

**Rice and three curries are usually served canteen style**

The canteen style menu changes daily in a weekly rota and many loyal customers have their favourite day – our editor loves it on Tuesdays for the ‘triple C’ of chicken, chickpea and cabbage curries, although she swears that the Sunday lamb nihari will banish any hangover.

Although the café is closed to sit-in diners, they are still open for take aways (social distancing measures taken into consideration) and now, by popular request, they are offering deliveries of special curry hampers to anywhere 'reasonably' close to their city centre cafe in the Northern Quarter. It isn’t possible to order individual curries, they are only offering the hampers – but as all This & That curries are freshly made, it’s a great opportunity to full your freezer so you can have that authentic curry caff experience at home.

**This & That is hidden down Soap Street in Mancheser's Northern Quarter**

This & That are offering 50% off all food for public workers (NHS / public workers need to show their ID on delivery/collection). You need to call the cafe to order on 0161 832 4971 (it's best to call in the afternoon). As a rough guide the delivery area covers within the M60 but the cafe team will confirm if the delivery is possible, and when. The driver will accept cash (in a safe manner) on arrival.

‘We're really happy to be able to keep our wonderful customers fed and to be able to show our appreciation to frontline workers,’ says Mo in a [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/ThisAndThatManchester) post, ‘and we really appreciate your custom - it's keeping us afloat (just about!) during these trying times.' 

Call This & That on 0161 832 4971 to check your delivery area and place your order today for delivery tomorrow.
