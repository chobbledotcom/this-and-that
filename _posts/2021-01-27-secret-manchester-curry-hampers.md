## Curry every day? Yes, please.

This & That Café is often fondly described as a Manchester institution, and it’s no surprise either, given they’ve been providing the city with tasty, homely curries for over 30 years now. Their ‘rice and three’ offering is incredibly popular, too, serving up a giant spoonful of rice topped with three curries of your choice.

And now, the much-loved restaurant is making sure we’re well-fed during lockdown, with their fantastic curry hampers which are jam-packed with hearty dishes. Perfect for feeding the whole house, there’s a variety of hampers to choose from – including one vegetarian choice and three meat options in different sizes. And the portions are hefty, too, with the smallest hamper likely to feed just one person for a couple of days.

Delivery is available for addresses within the M60, and NHS workers can benefit from 50% off their orders by simply showing their ID upon delivery. To make your order, call the restaurant on 0161 832 4971.
