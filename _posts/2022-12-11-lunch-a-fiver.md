Manchester is lucky to have a number of curry cafes serving up 'rice and three' - a large portion of rice teamed with no less than three curries on the side. But surely the best and most original is to be sourced from This & That - the no frills takeaway tucked down a side street in the Northern Quarter.

This restaurant is located on Soap Street, and serves up a veritable feast of daily changing curries, all paired with rice. On the menu you can choose from a selection of lamb curries, chicken or daal as well as interchangeable dishes that vary regularly.

The vegetarian option here will set you back £6, while the most expensive option - rice and three meats - still comes in under a tenner at £8. And yes, this sneaks in at a pound over budget but lunch and dinner came well under budget - giving you a little extra to splurge from the £15 quota.
