"Manchester’s prominent Indian and Pakistani community sprouted in the 1950s when many immigrants arrived looking for factory work. Generations later, the city has its own Curry Mile on Wilmslow Road, a 15-minute drive from downtown in the southern suburb of Rusholme—it’s the biggest conglomeration of South Asian restaurants in the UK. For korma without the commute, try This & That, hidden down a back alley on the edge of the Northern Quarter. It slings a delectable “rice and three”: a daily choice of rich lamb, chicken and veg curries served cafeteria-style atop a bed of basmati."
