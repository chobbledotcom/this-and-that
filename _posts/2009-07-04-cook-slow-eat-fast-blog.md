> "So I wanted to go out and grab some lunch and on the way could only think about this'n'that. When in Manchester I always revisit this place, not only for the food but also to remember that these places must be supported as much as possible."

"This place is open to everyone and they just about manage to pay the rent and earn a living for the family. Picnic chairs and tables mean overhead costs are minimal and consequently the great food on offer is inexpensive. About Â£4 a plate. A plate of rice and your choice of topping from several different curries; spinach and lamb curry, chicken curry, keema curry and a mixture of different sides such as potatoes and cabbage."

"You tell or point to the waiter the things that you fancy and they pile it on, some of the nicest curry dishes you can find in Manchester. I particularly liked the rice at This'n'that, it was so flavourful. They are also now open on Sundays so there is no excuse not to visit them."
