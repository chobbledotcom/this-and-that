By extremely popular demand, one of the city’s best Rice & Three venues is now offering up ‘**Curry Hampers**‘ for all of us stuck in our houses during the COVID-19 pandemic.

City favourite This & That will be delivering the hampers anywhere that is ‘reasonably close’ to the Northern Quarter cafe, with the cash accepting cash upon arrival.

The cafe remains open for takeaway ONLY and they’re also offering up 50% off for public workers (which applies to the hampers too)
