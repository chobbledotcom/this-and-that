## 4. This & That

A Manchester institution since the 80s, This & That is one of the city’s favourite spots for good Indian food, serving an ever-changing menu of homemade curries for guests to enjoy. And it’s a seriously cheap spot, too, with curries costing a maximum of £6! If you’re a veggie, even better, with prices of just £4.50 for a serving of rice with three different curries. The menu changes every day, so be sure to check what’s on next time you fancy a bit of spice in your life. This & That, Soap St, M4 1EW.
