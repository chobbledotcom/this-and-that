**"Earlier this month, we asked you to share your favourite spots in Greater Manchester when it came to South Asian food.**

**Whether it’s Indian curries, Pakistani delights, or Nepalese dumplings - we have been overwhelmed with the number of responses we’ve received.**

Established in 1984, there's a lot of reasons why This & That, on Soap Street, remains one of the most long-standing family-run establishments in the city.

This & That, 3 Soap Street, Manchester, M4 1EW."
