Manchester, home to one of the top Universities in England and famous for its excellent nightlife and live music scene, also has another draw for students trying to decide which University to go to. ‘The Curry Mile’ is the nickname given to the part of Wilmslow Road that stretches from the University campus through Rusholme in South Manchester, the area bordering the popular student area Fallowfield. The name is earned from the large number of restaurants, take-aways and kebab houses specialising in South Asian cuisine, and the road is thought to be the largest concentration of South Asian restaurants outside the Indian subcontinent. Within a stretch of half a mile there are at least seventy curry houses and takeaways, giving you plenty to choose from when you are craving that Indian takeaway after a night out. As a student of Manchester University myself, I had plenty of opportunities to try a wide variety of the restaurants both on the Curry Mile and beyond in the city  centre, so here is a list of what I believe are some of the best Indian restaurants in Manchester.

## 2. This and That

Located in the Northern Quarter and tucked on a side street, This and That is one of the best well known secrets in Manchester. This family run business has been well established since the 80s and offers a huge variety of fresh, homemade curries, and for extremely cheap. My favourite thing is to go in and ask for whatever they recommend. Trust me, you will leave full and extremely satisfied with the delicious plate of (budget friendly) curry that you have just wolfed down.
