Think of this next post as purely for my benefit, enabling me to refer you to the exemplar curry cafe whenever the mood takes me.

The **Holts** sunk, assorted Southworths and Mudgies headed for the Marble Arch, a pub of some repute I believe.

I set off for **Rochdale.** Not on foot.

Just like George Michael sang in 1986, I took a different corner and ended up here:

An easy mistake.

**Why does your tummy always rumble when you walk past a curry cafe?**

It was a choice of rag pudding and turps in an hour in the ‘Dale, or Rice’n’Three _right_ now.

I succumbed.

I’ve been coming here for 25 years on and off since Manchester’s CAMRA branches added a curry section to their guide to the best places to drink Drabs in Mancly.

But even I would never claim this is the best food in town, just a warm and healthy bargain in a scary alley.

My lad has been regaling me with tales of it being “_better than ever_“, and I reckon there is more meat than I remember. Is this gentrification?

£6.50 for a massive plate of spinach, dhal and beef.

£6.50 won’t buy you a half of milkshake turnip sour in the Northern Quarter these days, as Matt also knows.

_Only one thing could dampen my euphoria at falling in love with This & That. A faint memory of something_ **_retiredmartin_** _once wrote about_ _never_ _drinking beer after curry._
