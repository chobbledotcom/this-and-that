"Hidden down a backstreet, This & That has been serving its legendary 'rice and three' since 1984. No frills, no fuss – just trays of steaming, home-style curries ladled over rice for a loyal crowd of locals, students and visitors in-the-know. The menu rotates daily, from lamb and pumpkin to keema and vegetable biryani, with chicken tikka masala ever-present. Inside, it's simple canteen style: stainless steel trays, fast-moving queues and the comforting aroma of spice and steam. Cheap, cheerful and unmistakably Mancunian, This & That is more than a curry café — it's a piece of the city's soul."
