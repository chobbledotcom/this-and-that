A little hidden gem tucked away behind Trof NQ, This & That is a family-run restaurant thatâ€™s not to be overlooked. The classic menu has a huge choice of curries, from Biryani to Tikka dishes. Each day features a different menu, with a variety of meaty options and three vegetarian options available daily. The small and simple restaurant has been running since the 80s, making it one of the longest-running favourites in the city. Long wooden tables and stripped back decor allow for social seating, while the focus remains on the flavours. All dishes are homemade with fresh, whole spices and meats such as lamb, chicken and fish consistently featuring throughout the week. This & That, 3 Soap St, Manchester, M4 1EW.
