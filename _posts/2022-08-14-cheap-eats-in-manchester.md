Manchester’s Northern Quarter is famous for its varied selection of eateries serving up ‘rice and three’ - a generous portion of rice accompanied by no less than three curries on the side. Probably the first place you’ll be directed if you after your fix though is This & That, a family run curry house tucked away on Soap Street.

The vegetarian option here will set you back £6, while the most expensive option - rice and three meats - still comes in under a tenner at £8. Open seven days a week, curries here change often - more excuse to pop back in on your next lunch break.

3 Soap St, Manchester M4 1EW
